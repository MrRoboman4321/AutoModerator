Parents bring food for dinner wednesdays and lunches saturdays and we all eat together and thereâ€™s usually dessert and actual meals that donâ€™t require microwaving. Itâ€™s awesome
One of the coolest parts of build season aside from actually building is the family meals we have twice a week
<@U7PBR1J4B> And there's a lot more coming in the actual competition season!
<@U1F0P4FA5> It taught me the true meaning of glucose.
<@U7388S8CF> That's good to hear! My first year on the team, I noticed that build/competition season was way more fast-paced and way more fun than the preseason 
It's getting me excited for kickoff! :)
