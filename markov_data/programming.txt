this year yeah
rip. looks like it happened recently too.
any who, the two teams are 16 and 323
oh just the switch from today to tomorrow wasn't expecting it
?
WOAAH
that sounds about right
Bomb and squad?
they are two teams now
have they been having trouble too?
aviation themed
uniforms, swerve drives, rgb, and the split
RGB is the way to go
how do you mean?
I think we are more like bomb squad then we'd like to be
tfw
next stop: bomb squad
the swerve's have been around for a while, but I get what you mean
now rgb
first swerve
omg it's amazing
RGB LED over CAN
its happened

<@U7PBR1J4B> the things that Thomas posted are good exercises for getting used to new data structures
Making a game is pretty cool, but getting the libraries set up is a hassle
those would be my suggestions
<https://github.com/Skunkworks1983/Skunkworks-code-exercises> now has java instructions for robotInventory and linkedList
<@U1F1ETJM7> Making a game seprerately
And making a game with it, or making a game separately?
Sudoku
<@U1F1ETJM7> Dillon brought up the idea of re-doing the library without looking back at the original code, and making a game. I'm more inclined to do the game, so I'll try to do that. Before I go looking for one to make, any suggestions about what it should require me to do? Any input is appreciated.
yeah, well he probably finished Codecademy. There are a few options you have
Codecademy :ok_hand:
Hey guys, does anyone know of any resources to practice OOP, or java in general?
<@U1F0M6Z6D> has joined the group
<@U1F1ETJM7> Marco and Ethan need help getting wpilib, are you available?
Chiming in here.  I did give Naba a key for IntelliJ.  I have more if needed.
I've thought about it
anyone checked out networktables yet?
Okay
Alternatively, you can send an email to <@U7RLA5T62> asking for a key
You can install the community edition without Admin
so, back to McLaughlin?
Download IntelliJ community

Okay, meet me in Joshis right after school if you can <@U7QAKUNLW> 
We tried adding it in project structure
We already installed it but we don't know what to do with it
Use the installer while you're logged in, get a teacher to put in their credentials when they ask for them (just explain its for robotics), then there are a few more steps
<https://www.kauailabs.com/public_files/navx-mxp/navx-mxp.zip>
Have you guys installed the Kauai Labs libraries yet?
Dillon and I are trying to put NavX in our code but its not working, how do we go about this
<!channel> Just a heads up so you guys can plan; There is still no meeting next tuesday (Nov 21). However, the following week, there will be an extra meeting on Wednesday (Nov 29). Also, I'd like to make it standard that you throw me a heads up if you won't make a meeting (either here or in a direct message). This won't be as important pre-season, but during build season if you are working on a part and aren't here the day it needs to be tested, I need to know that so that we can work around it. Thanks!

<!channel> hey so Naba wants to leave
okay
as it defines the order that they're meant to be called it
because `Command.run()` is the only thing that should call them
so that they don't get called out of order by things that aren't `Command.run()`
okay, so protected so that they don't get called out of order by Command.run()?
so protected is the next best thing
ideally they would be private because they should only be called by `Command.run()`, but subclasses can't override private methods because they don't know they exist
but out of order != can be called
yes
<https://stackoverflow.com/questions/215497/in-java-difference-between-default-public-protected-and-private> is what I found, it looks like they can be called out of the subclass of command?
making them protected prevents them from being called out-of-order outside of subclasses of `Command`
those methods are parts of a strategy that are supposed to be called in a specific order, which is defined in `Command.run()`
no friends in java?? how lonely
commands use the strategy pattern <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy_pattern>
no friends in java
;)
because friends can only access your privates with protection
<@U1F0LEQ3W> Why protected init, exec, interrupt and end?
Gyro is functional. We will need a teacher (admin) to log onto the computers and install the navx mxp library, then move a file over, but it actually was pretty easy beyond that to get setup

If you guys go from programming to cheese and some fairly impressive puns during pre-season, what's going to happen during build season?
when we're setting people up with jdk I'll start checking 32 vs 64 bit. I'm guessing the difference (from a visual perspective only) would be installing in Program Files vs. x86?
Ah ok
I think the main issue was jdk 1.8 vs 1.9 vs jre vs exe

<@U1F0LEQ3W> That's what it looks like.

JDK 1.8 is in a folder marked "FRC-SOFTWARE 2017"
<@U1F0LEQ3W> uploaded a file: <https://skunkworksteam1983.slack.com/files/U1F0LEQ3W/F7RNSNQ9J/image.png|if it looks like this, you only have the JRE installed>
I'm not sure what's up with the "bin" and "lib" but from that I don't think you have jdk 1.8 installed
lib
bin
jre1.8.0_131
There is:
Can you navigate to "C:\Program Files\Java" and list what's in there?
I'm not sure if I can give you a clear answer on that. I opened the "jdk-9_windows-x64_bin.exe", but all it did was ask me for admin credentials.
Are you sure the jdk is installed or is it just the installer
<@U7PBL4GTV> Yes, and we're struggling
<@U7PBR1J4B> Are you trying to set the jdk location to some folder
Ok
Ok, then we'll do it here
I can for sure help you tomorrow at some point but going to MC again probably won't help, unless you're missing software.
I don't count on McLaughlin to fix these kind of things; he's great at installing things but I wouldn't trust him to set up my dev environment fully
sound lit
MC glock
Here, how about we just fix this when we're at school? I can go to MC Glock, and see if he can fix this. If push comes to shove, I'll do it on ms word and get it reviewed by you guys.
I think I know what you're asking, and I'll see.
<@U7PBR1J4B>
Can you post a screenshot of your "jkd1.8.0_&lt;something&gt;" directory, and confirm that the Java SDK is pointed to that?
~I hate computers~
I know where it is, I'm just getting a different error.
did you end up finding ur jdk ?
Yeah, I'll try to figure it out
uhh
Intellij
what program ?
They're not atm
I'm getting the same error I was getting when I tried pasting the program to my desktop while I had my desktop icons hidden
<@U7PBL4GTV>
Usually, nothing does, but I did the rain dance a couple times last night, so I've got high hopes
Did it work
Done. I'll restart intellij
<@U1F0LEQ3W> uploaded a file: <https://skunkworksteam1983.slack.com/files/U1F0LEQ3W/F7SHBSL06/image.png|if the folder you're pointing intellij at doesn't look like this, it's not the right one>
it should have installed to C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_(whatever version) by default
I'll change the location, and see if it works
also <@U1F0W3FFC> we're using java 8
it should be in program files i think
I'm assuming that's not good?
what's in that folder?
the jdk folder is in your downloads?
wait
Nice
<@U1F0LEQ3W> help
ok i have a solution dont worry
ok lmao
Yup
?
is the folder unzipped
This PC &gt; Downloads &gt; ROBOTICS &gt; JDK
where is ur jdk located, just curious
^
Thats what it says
The selected directory is not a valid home for JDK
my jdk is @ C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-9
Keeps saying SDK doesn’t exist 
I'll try it a again and see
Yeah I’m having the same thing 
whatd it say?
Returned an error
hmm
I tried that one
called something like jdk-1.8 or something
nah it should be the folder with the jre
desktop/intellij
;)
select the home directory for the jdk 
Currently in the process of launching intellij. It wants me to select a home directory for JDK; Upperclassmen, come to my rescue
For now, new students will be working and learning together with mentor support, and the others will be learning wpi Java from the start
so have we decided if we're doing partner programming or
are you a wizard

that's like

it's an island
java isn't a programming language
guys I just looked it up
classes are :fire:
I'm literally doing classes on Java right now
darn, looks like we have to go back 
same
just googled it, turns out java doesn't have classes or switch case 
<@U1F0W3FFC> you're in luck
At least they if/else
is there even switch case in java , seems like something only a high iq language would have 
you can join them
I think they may be starting the robotic arm project
yeah.....
Is it too late to join SciOli?
we switch/case on this team only.....
oh .... nobody told him??
<@U1F0QEL0Z> Just if/else(if) the hell outta that
then it crashes the fms!!!!!!!
someone's preseason project should be putting speakers on the robot with the turret voice tbh 
but what if there isn't a function on the other side that takes strings???????
now you're thinking with portals
if the fms sends a string with scores, why don't we just edit that string, make our score higher, and send it back????:thinking_face::thinking_face::thinking_face::thinking_face::thinking_face::thinking_face:
That's not a guarantee for anyone affiliated with FIRST.
whoa, don't get too memey now
;_;
Oh, ok. The people in the airships needed that for free gears <@U1F0LEQ3W>
so like, if they wanted to add a gate as part of the field that was software controlled, this would be the way to check on its state
make the robot drive at 200% throttle if the opposing alliances score is higher :triumph::triumph:

<@U7PBR1J4B> there are already mechanisms for that, I think this is specifically for the state of the game rather than the state of the robot or the field
string separated by robot emojis :robot_face: 
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
If I'm getting this right, are there gonna be status updates from the robot to the drive team?
```&gt;json```
"power_up_dead_bot"
"Game Specific data string" is hella sketchy tho
depending on implementation
hey that's actually not bad
"Starting this year, WPILib, in all 3 languages, will have APIs to access a Game Specific data string which will contain information sent from the Field Management System to the Robot (via the Driver Station). There will also be a new text box in the Driver Station which will allow teams to simulate this functionality when testing at home. The implementation has been kept as generic as possible to allow for maximum flexibility as we use this new feature in future years."

<@U1F0QEL0Z> yes but that's already a thing, just give other robots hard enough love taps

that disables all the other teams robots

Hey programming, where do I create the wallet? I'm not sure what program was installed on my computer.
Heh it's all good
Interesting. I’ll take a peak when I’m next in. I dot. Want to distract the team with my crazy experiments 
Theyve locked us out of the first since forever, and the second as of this year
Unfortunately
That'd work if we could edit our environment var OR our local environment var
Basically you unpack it on system you have rights to and then push the JDK to a usb drive then copy it over. Yes it makes some things easier if you install the default way but there is nothing requiring it
Yes because Java doesn’t care where it is installed. It is a Windows convention that it get installed there. You just point your environment variable and IDE to wherever you installed it.
<@U7RLA5T62> can you do jdk w/o admin even if we don't have w access to /Programfiles/?
And you can ask one of the teachers for jdk
When you launch intellij it prompts for a password and i just used mine, worked fine
If anyone is curious, happy to walk you through all the steps when we have free time
JDK still requires admin for sanity.  It is possible to install JDK without admin rights but it requires some hoops to jump through
Also by the way for those in the future that were worried about needing admin rights, you can install IntelliJ without Admin rights.  <https://intellij-support.jetbrains.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/206899909-Is-it-possible-to-install-on-windows-as-standard-user>
Oh ok
Most likely won't *need* them.  The community edition provides 95% of what you would need.  There were some Thursday that didn't have the community edition but had the full edition and only had the 30 day trial.  I reached out to JetBrains and they offered us complimentary licenses if we wanted them to their entire product suite.  Not mandated but available if we want the full edition instead of community.
Why do we need licenses, like my intellij seems to work fine
Ok as the requestor, I am the one who needs to hand out IntelliJ licenses.  If you need/want a license, shoot me a note and I'll send you the link.
Cool.
Generally the community keys are twelve months but a piece of cake to renew. JetBrains likes to do this stuff.
Do those keys have an expiry?
For the ones that got trial that probably makes sense, yeah.
Should be able to just drop keys in and go
But I know there were a few that we think installed trial instead of community 
If its a redownload, we will need admin on the computers again which is a hassle, and I would be tentative unless there are significant advantages to ultimate &gt; community
Will we need to redownload the ultimate edition, or can we do a straight upgrade once it's downloaded?
Hey everyone. JetBrains approved free full licenses for IntelliJ for the team. I have 20. When I’m back home this evening, I will get the information out. I’ll need someone to be the keeper/distributor of the keys. 
<!channel> 
Hey all. With the limited amount of time left in pre-season, we gotta start setting some due dates to make sure that we can move forward as a team. By tuesday, I want everyone to have completed the Java Codecademy course. It's pretty short, and I know most of you have already done a good portion or a majority of it, so it shouldn't be too much work. If you get stuck, you can direct message Mr Vader, Thomas DeSilva or I with questions. After you finish the codecademy, the next step is to show off you object-oriented skills by making a Calculator class that will do math based on user input. If you guys get there, I'll post more specifics on what that should look like. Thanks and see you all at Girls Gen.
<@U7RLA5T62> has joined the group

anyone going to the wpi presentation?
Yes
hek no
anyone in comp sci club? :evan_irl: 
Also, my apologies, earlier I said David Hadley was elected to the steering committee. It was instead Evan Frishholz
Questions/random talk can come here or through private messages
Beyond that, just keep working away at Codecademy. The basic steps for you to follow right now are finish the Java Codecademy course, then go through the Git "Hello World" tutorial. After that, we'll set you up with some more challening projects.
Between now and Thursday, keep trying to get to McLaughlin and get your development environments installed. We want to get this done as soon as possible so as many of you can get working on robot code before too long, which is a big step forward.
<!channel> Everybody should be in here now, please tell me ASAP if you see anybody that's missing. Slack is our main mode of communication, you're expected to be able to be contacted on it regularly. It's not as big of a deal pre-season, but during build season it can be critical to be able to get a hold of somebody at a moments notice. I forgot to mention this at the meeting tonight, but you should get slack on your phones as well and setup notifications, so that your presence here isn't solely linked to you being on your laptop.

<https://stackoverflow.com/a/33066581/5217216> this is probably a good thing for people to read as java works the same way
yeah
I think that's the trick here
well, in this case the value that you're assigning is a reference
I had been taught that python was 100% pass by value
I know but I didn't think python didn't do any pass by reference
remember that with arrays, the variable stores a pointer to the first index, so you are indeed dealing with a reference
to be fairer in a non-copypasta kind of way, you'd get the same behavior if you did that in C/C++
*sigh*
To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Python. The language is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of it will go over a typical programmer's head. 
I'm trying to debug code and I have an array that's changing when I never change the value of it anywhere, so I think its gotta be something to do with this
```
abc = [1, 2, 3]
xyz = abc
abc[0] = 0
&gt;&gt;&gt;abc
[0, 2, 3]
&gt;&gt;&gt;xyz
[0, 2, 3]
xyz[0] = 1
&gt;&gt;&gt;abc
[1, 2, 3]
&gt;&gt;&gt;xyz
[1, 2, 3]
```
but arrays
```
a = 5
b = a
a = 2
&gt;&gt;&gt;b
5
```
most of the times when you set one variable equal to another, you're setting a copy
python is a terrifying language
did you delete a message nathan or is slack being buggy

His safety is thrice mine
thats the spirit
It's less a challenge and more a thorough defeat
mike has a challenger
What dangers could he withstand?
I cower at the sight of this man 
Reddit dot com slash are slash eff are see
not me, from reddit
I doubt it was you
Is that you? Where is that picture taken?

IFTTT is awesome
the rest are all basically new.
There is 1 that could be useful, and 1 that has done work with c++
If they were smart they would have found a way to not be freshmen
are there any smart fresh people?
lets get them to learn labview
What
uhh
oops
leader of fresh people bella bella bella mike
Have them learn 2017 or slippery which eases them into build seeaosn 
ok so who is gonna be the fresh prince of fresh people
i agree with tucker
We'll let them teach themselves to program while we make the chairmans video
I think your idea works
?
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nCqRmx3Dnw>
wait so have we figured out what we're doing with the freshpeople?
Let's all join satellite
let's all become logistic leads
I feel personally targeted 
Let's just all go to chairmans
Ha jokes on you me and Nathan are switching places
Ree get out design normie
Noooooooo000000oooo00oooooo
r i p
Let's round it to a yes
Shame it's such a close call
Pleaaassseee
Kick Tucker?
We should make a 4H computer science team
lmao who would ever want to learn how to program
Make it robotics programming club
Should we join or nahhhh
^
We can tell it's awkward by the fact that you're on slack rather than participating lol
i _guess_
Yea I guess
dear lord its so awkward
Eh it’ll look good for colleges
aidan
jon wick and aiden k
Who started it?
Yeah I don't know why I expected anything different
Big rip
Lmao that’s what I expected 
There are 6 people here, only 2 of us that aren't leading the meeting know code, and it's just incredibly awkward and not so hot
Rip I was gonna go what’s going on
dear lord the comp sci club that is being started at our school is no bueno
Official list of what you'll be getting if you go down to MC
Software
IntelliJ - Java IDE that will allow us to write code
FRC IntelliJ plugin - Software written for IntelliJ to provide more robust tools specifically for development with Java in an FRC context
JDK 1.8 - Java Development Kit, requried to compile any kind of java program.
FRC Update Suite - Various software and backend libraries to allow us to run other required software (Driverstation, SmartDashboard, etc)
CTRLib - A library that we will need downloaded and put into the WPILib user folder (downloaded and installed through the FRC Update Suite)
Git - Version control software that allows for the team to manage multi person development of the code base.
I didn't get an email but Joshi might be confirming directly.
Alright it's been two minutes are we good
nice
Once he sends the email
Literally in about 2 minutes
so whens the earliest we can get stuff on our computers
oh
He didn't understand he needed to confirm, so he's sending an email to mclaughlin right now
I'll check
did the program list get approved by joshi/mclaughlin
Sure, that's one idea
but if they have their own project they're working on for slippery/2017 they can pick up some skills without worrying about anyone undoing
none of the freshmen are going to learn anything if we just keep re-writing their code
right, maybe it might be better if that's what they do year round 
It's totally doable preseason
We won't have things for them to do
I'm just concerned about build season
they get experience with a legit robot and we dont have to worry about stepping on them
sounds kinda bad but maybe we should just let the freshpeople work on a previous years robot
*dab*
._.
1983 and 7005
What do you mean?
Two teams?
We need a way to trim that number down, I just don't see it working
9 new students
There are far too many freshman that have joined programming
Yeah, that was really chaotic
today was an example of why mentors are required
Angelina_irl
^ too much caffeine
A black hole is actually a communist conception, you see they'll claim that black holes are made of matter when holes are really the lack of material.

Okay...
Talked to Joshi, he says he’s gonna sign off on it and talk to McLaughlin 
joshi still hasn't responded to the email .-.

its not the same without greentext
I couldn't make a linked list when I was a freshman either

U wot
thought you tuckered us for a second

nah jk
oh lord
when did this happen
:notlikethis:
cya
a360
beautiful thing called
betrayed
not using command line this year
so you can use that if you're not willing to brave the command line like nathan
intellij actually has git integration anyway
foiled again
I mean we don't need admin to do that
spooked
evil plan complete
you've been bamboozled, that list didn't contain a graphical git client
Sent the email to joshi and mc, just waiting on a confirmatoin email
<@U1F0KR9BR> set the channel's topic: buy mgs2
no problem.
And WPILib is part of the FRC Update Suite
kind of busy right now though
it's not
Going through and listing software to install, step 5 is not needed for mclaughlin right?

I have the opportunity to put together a list right now
<@U1F0LEQ3W> Where is the Java setup guide?
Joshi*
Okay, then if nothing changes before tomorrow I'll present the list to JOshi
<@U1F1ETJM7> we need to get that list approved as soon as we can do that we make sure we can get everything downloaded before approval becomes a lot more complicated 
I think the list is the stuff on the java setup guide, the FRC update suite, and git, but I might be forgetting something
I've talked to him about it, just need the list
Joshi is going to sign off on the list
so joshi is the one signing off on the list or is that someone else
Mr Vader was going to test Thomas's list before I confirmed with joshi and got it to McLaughlin
so what's the situation with the program list for mclaughlin?
^ yee
That module can then be actually built for programmers to play with 
:ok_hand:
Payton can incorporate it into his new drive base design for the mock build season
wowowowowowowow
Lol
WOAHAHAAHHA
(shes right next to me rn)
but it will be in cad
I just talked to Izzie about preseason projects and suggested it
we aren't going to build a robot
the | is on the right side, the -- is on the left
design team is going through a whole mock build season, If you guys want to talk with us while we are doing that we can integrate sensors and things like that into the design
and lots of math
right; they had one | and one --
and you need to have a way of dealing with rotation, so you either need two or to not care about rotation and put it dead center
well, and a place to mount it to
on a suspension
We shouldn't need an extra motor port; just an axle with an encoder
yeah
Then it's just incorporated during build season as an "x by y by z" volume slot on the drivebase
Naively it should be a preseason design project
I mean
we've talked about doing that but never had the space/time
they're on a suspension so they should stay engaged all the time
they have 2 sets of omnis that are just for encoding
<https://youtu.be/ewTCvLp5EUo?t=1m24s> pause it as soon as it starts
O:clap:P:clap:E:clap:N:clap:          L:clap:O:clap:O:clap:P:clap:
254 OP? 
:benton_irl::benton_irl::benton_irl::benton_irl::benton_irl:
• Shooter controller
o Use PID to spin up to the correct RPM based on the
distance from the target
o Once RPM has stabilized around the setpoint, start
gathering average kF samples
o Once enough kF samples have been gathered, switch
to pure kF control for essentially open loop shooting
<https://goo.gl/76UgcN>
you should link them
I've started looking through some of them
anyone read 254's 2017 technical docs?

what is 2906? 
Pretty much
Is that all they're known for now 
Exactly 
With the robot that caught on fire ?
The robotics team?
:notlikethis:
Have you heard of 2906
Sounds good. And no problem. Hopefully I won't burn anything this time 
Vanilla would be awesome thanks Naba
