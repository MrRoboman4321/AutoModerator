Was Nigel counting?
`Lmaooooo
Whoops.....
<@U1F0P4FA5> and I came up with it :+1::skin-tone-3:
what a spicy name
Right. Ok thanks
Newkidzontheblock <@U7PF8BHTN>
Is there a underclassmen channel? Just wondering
did you get it back?
I have good reason to believe that it was Nigel Barnett 
Someone took my laptop. Please return it immediately
it was to get everybodys input so far only 2 freshman and 1 sophmore has responded
Well it was kind of linking the survey in this channel with the wombold meeting
omg do this in upperclassmen not student
If she isn't, then we have other things to talka bout
Wombold is defining the wombold meeting
She's not saying to ignore the problem, either define the wombold meeting as being a place to talk about whatever you want or set specific points about what to talk about. That was my point with the meme about I don't know what the meeting is about, Bella explained that its about whatever whoever has a problem with, and that's cool, it would just be nice if someone said that here. Which I guess I just did.
Ignoring problems won’t solve them, but if it isn’t a major issue then we won’t need to talk about it
<@U1F0P4FA5> because some *students* might have problems with mentors or leads, and if we get enough data saying that this is true, i don’t see why we would ignore it.
if its relevant, we use it
Because, as it current stands, some student relations are being affected by mentor interactions
if its not relevant, its not relevant, and we dont' use it
does it matter?
izzie
in case it comes up
But if the Wombold meeting is about student relations, why are mentors and lead performance relevant? <@U1F0M8ZTP> 
<@U1JM7GF7E> has joined the group
<@U1F408NA0> uploaded a file: <https://skunkworksteam1983.slack.com/files/U1F408NA0/F87ES4K7T/20a2s2.jpg|20a2s2.jpg>
<@U1F0P4FA5> it’s not all about the mentors, it’s about all parts of the team. Mentors, students, subteam relations, etc. This survey will give us an idea of what people think are issues or unsatisfactory on the team anonymously, so we can bring it up at the wombold meeting and no single person has to be uncomfortable bringing it up
<@U1F0QEL0Z> uploaded a file: <https://skunkworksteam1983.slack.com/files/U1F0QEL0Z/F88RG8MJS/1511871226795.jpg|1511871226795.jpg> and commented: Another survey
I mean if its not a big deal then who cares, we can use the results somewhat casually. Depends how seriously we want to take the results of the survey for freshman and sophomores. <@U1F1ETJM7>
also we can filter the responses by junior/senior submission
do you want a third survey, juniors and seniors only? I think we can just use the results from this one, even if freshman/sophomores submitted it. Its not that big of a deal
But anyways, I still think that because the purpose of the survey is for the Wombold meeting, which only juniors and seniors are attending, the survey should only be for juniors and seniors in the upperclassmen group chat. Furthermore, a lot of freshmen and sophomores don't have opinions on lots of this stuff yet, or are not informed on some of the questions yet.
Is it just me or did my comment get deleted not by me
Please fill out the survey:smiley:
I still don't understand how this helps with the Wombold meeting if it is all about the mentors now <@U1F0M8ZTP> 
<https://goo.gl/forms/ZRZW1WBPGkH7Uq3n1>
<!channel> last notification I promise! Here is the final survey link. A few people filled out the old one, but *please* fill it out again; changes were made so those responses had to be deleted. All members are encouraged but not required to fill it out. The survey is anonymous, but please only submit one response. Response data will be published sometime tomorrow. Goodnight everyone!
Gotcha
it will be published results, it is all anonymous so people can be honest
<@U1F0M8ZTP> Will we get a chance to see the results, or is the survey to better guide the team leads?
Oh okay....
Deleted 
Was that in this thread? If so I am missing a message. First one I saw rn was Evan's question 
Another survey
What being moved?
its being moved
What approved?
Erin approved it <@U1F05PEAY>
Was this approved by any of the team leads or anyone?
interesting
<!channel> anyone interested in attending who did not contribute food can give me money for admission right after school or now and then if I get enough I can run to costco and pick something extra up for everyone
ok
Juniors and Seniors are going on Thursday. most of these messages should have been posted in a different channel, sorry for the confusion
is everyone going to group therapy?
Well at the moment this has next to no context for the entire team, it just seems like it's coming out of nowhere because it came from design. So the team as a whole needs to address specific issues one at a time and come up with solutions instead of complaining. Right now, one of those solutions is the group therapy, so it doesn't make much to bring up a ton of more issues when tomorrow we're going to work on fixing issues during the group therapy <@U2A68KU8K> 
Do it if you want, tell me how to make it better.
Everyone not in design is probably super confused where this is coming from, because it started in design and migrated over here
Jesus Christ we have group therapy for this just hold off
^ that, I feel like the questions are in the wrong pretense for the meeting tomorrow, if that was the original intent.
Do we need a survey at all?
If people want to give me input and/or add questions let me know and I am more than willing. I have already done it 
Why didn't you just edit the first one???
*confused
im so cnfused
Don't worry, everyone loves pie :D
Well Friendsgiving just got a whole lot more awkward 
In front of literally everyone
Discussing this at the meeting will just make it take forever and stir up bad feelings.
Same <@U1F0QEL0Z>
<https://youtu.be/JR5_ytqLXXM>
I think the vote is clear, the answer is :glory:
Exactly <@U1F0KHF71>
Wait what
A vote on whether we should have a vote lmao
should we put out the survey through the vote function on slack
I'd say that works
You mean the initial meeting with literally everyone there?
We should discuss it at the meeting tonight
Should we have a poll/vote on using that survey or not
Maybe hold off on the surveys until tonight’s meeting.
So do we agree that the survey shouldn't be used because of the bias involved with the questions? And that perhaps someone else should make a survey?
Well I do apologize. This was not meant to target a specific person and if someone else would like to make a more unbiased survey I would be more than happy to fill it out 
This really hurt. It might not have been easy for you to send out a survey like that <@U2A68KU8K> but it definitely wasn't easy for me to read and I feel targeted by that survey. That was unacceptable.
Payton I must say that the way the questions in this survey were worded made them seem very biased and created false dilemmas. I think it was worth gathering some anonymous information about team sentiments as a whole but the questions need to be more objective.
<@U1F0P4FA5> <@U1F0QEL0Z> i just want to know what everyone thinks about everything. I asked about leads, sub-teams, mentors, so its only fair to ask about drive team too. I would rather know where everyone stands and focus on those points than take random shots in the dark and hope people agree with me. If we try to improve something i want us all to know we are doing it for the entire team and not just a small group. I want to focus on the things that we all want to focus on. Ill publish all results so we can see where we are all at. I apologize if this seems biased. i have always had a vision of this team, i believed that we could be (and believe that we can still) this great powerful positive, a team that helped each other up and strived to be the best while being a family. Ive been let down a little to much lately. I dont want to push myself up, i want to lead from within just like Bowlin wants. I made this survey quickly and i apologize for showing bias. My intent was to collect information that would be helpful for all. I believe this will help or else i wouldnt be doing it. If i didnt care i wouldnt be on the team. I wouldnt have spent my own personal time trying to figure out where everyone stands so I know the issues so i know im not trying to fix things that dont need to be fixed. There are so many problems going on and i feel like everyone is scared to speak up and say whats on their mind. that's the goal of the survey, speak your mind. No one seems to try and fix the problem. We all know there is multiple, especially in design build, but no one is truly willing to stand up and try and solve it. Was this easy for me to send out a survey like this??? NO! I know people wont like me for this but im willing to take that hit so everyone can see what everyone is thinking, to show we all want the same things. I am sorry if i ever came off like a rude arrogant ass, it has never, and will never, be my intent or goal. again i want to help fix things but i want to know where to focus my energy. I want us to all stand together happy, healthy, and a strong family. I have a vision for the team that i hope many of you share. This is the way i think we can be this strong united force we all want to be. WE all want that, getting there is how we all differ. I challenge all of us to work toward that goal together
To me Payton it seems like you made this to try and create some sort of false pretense that you are a commissar of truth and help for the team, while actively trying to subvert your peers in a way to push your self up. You made this survey with useful topics mixed in with topics that do not need to be brought up right now, and to me it seems as though you are doing this under an emotional knee-jerk reaction to your feelings. You know this and try and base your self in some sort of truth by being helpful. I appreciate you trying to help, but when you actively try and pull people to your point of view it seems to me extremely inappropriate in this context. I know you want to help the team, but in a way like this it does not help your case.
Well I would like to know the purpose of this survey, and that's not really relevant to healing
izzie, we can bring these concerns up on thursday
About drive team performance? That's pointed at three specific people
It was more a way to see where everyone stands on everything. A way to get our thoughts in the open
But how would drive team and lead performance inform a meeting with Wombold?
would people agree with that?
I hope that we can use this information to better inform our discussions with Wombold, hopefully moving us forward enough that we won’t need to ever use the data again.
What will be done with this information? Other than the Wombold meeting
fixed
I was thinking you should revise it so freshmen don't have to answer drive team questions, the point is so the survey gets fixed
<@U2A68KU8K> pinned a message to this channel.
I dont see your point in nit picking. Its just to get info. Im not perfect im sorry
you can abstain and put 0
Also u made the drive team stuff required, but then u said only upperclassmen should answer...
its just an option. its not perfect im sorry.
If anything why isn't it a specific name if u don't want it to be anonymous
But why is it an option
not required
Why is there a student ID #
Especially before the meeting that we’ll be having with Wombold.
Hey guys if you could all fill this out so we can all have a better understanding of what everyone's thoughts of the team are it'd be really helpful

"The way most organizing groups like this, you have a standard notification of meeting so people can plan and a minimum number of members must be present, but unless it is a permanent vacancy the meeting moves ahead with those present.

oh alright
(The ones that are voted on anyway, not coach or tipton or admin)
All representatives to the steering committee
Student representative to the council thingy
Brexit
sorry but the voting is for what?
I'll ask him about that; it should be figured out before vote time
Would u be willing to email him? Or we could just ask at the meeting
I hadn't considered that, and I didn't bring it up with Mr. Smith.
Other consideration: what happens if the rep gets violently sick? Should the second choice be a back-up rep?
The idea is that the selected representative is the most approved nominee, not necessarily the majority's #1 choice
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Approval_voting>
1. We only vote on people who have been nominated/have self nominated
2. Everybody gets to vote for as many people as they want, but only once for each nominee
3. The person with the most votes is elected; as they are the person that the most people would be comfortable with as the nominee
4. If there's a tie for 1st, the vote is redone with only the nominees who had the most votes the first time around, again voting for as many as each pleases.
Eli you only put it in the seniors 
Lemme repost it here
My bad I had posted that in a different channel
What voting system did you propose?
Just a heads up; If I understand correctly the voting system I proposed is going to be the default used for other groups in the team as well
Both teams are at school on Tuesday 
4-H not done, but no 4-H meeting 
or 5I
It's I-5
what?
shit nice 
4H is done dude. We've moved on to 5H
._.
but where's 4h meeting 
right 
"that we have reached an agreement,"
there’s one meeting
Do we know if discussion of the progress made will be all that's done at the meeting tues? Or will we have time for preseason projects etc
Just 1 set of meetings at this point it sounds like.
so where's the 4h meeting gonna be 
email just came out from Jim Smith to everybody (hopefully)
Team,
Below is a message from School Board President Bernie Dorsey.  A small group met Sunday to continue working on defining a path forward for Skunkworks at the school. We invite Students, Parents and Mentors to come to the team meeting Tuesday at 6pm at RAHS to listen to the progress we have made, to ask questions, and help define the path forward.
 
Jim Smith
 
 
Hello all,
 
Thank you, again, for taking the time to work on the path forward for Robotics at RAHS. I am always impressed, and often amazed, at the level of commitment we all share for students and school.
 
Please share through your various networks, that we have reached an agreement, not one that is full and complete, but rather one that will enable us to move forward with the task at hand. An agreement that will achieve what we all desire, a unified team, anchored to RAHS, that will continue the tradition so many have worked so hard to build.
 
Rather than try to put into words all that was discussed, and all that has been worked through in the last two weeks, let’s all convene on Tuesday and we will navigate the path forward together. I would only ask that we continue to recognize that there are still questions to ask and answers to be found, but that we have somewhere to start.
 
I sincerely appreciate all that people have given to the team and to this process.
 
Please let Joe and I know when and where the team practice/meeting will be held so we can attend and assist in communicating the proposal to all concerned.
 
Take care and thanks again,
 
Bernie
I believe he has been included because he knows the most about the financial stuff, since he ran it all until this year
The issues started when he was still here, so he still has a say in things

Bernie’s message:

 

Hello all,

 

Thanks to everyone that attended last evening’s meeting. Your thoughts and input was incredibly valuable in providing a direction for which to continue towards a unified team at RAHS.

 

As a result of that meeting we have decided to further postpone practice to tentatively take place on 10/17. I realize this is a further delay at a critical point in the season. But in order to work toward getting things back on track, it is a necessary step.

 

The next piece on the path forward will be for myself, Joe Van, Ms. Tipton and a representative group of mentors to meet as soon as we are able. We are all in high hopes that this will lead us to the solution we all seek.

 

Thanks in advance for your understanding of the additional delay. And please join us in committing to a long term solution.

 

Take care,

 

Bernie

We can get started on the garnet and just set it off to the side until the trucks get here
If you know you are for sure attending and going to help clean, say so and we can at least start a schedule and for everyone else who shows up it can be first come first serve. Sound okay?
Where is the schedule for shifts?
We are waiting on Jerry, the trucks, and the MoF to open the gates so we can drive the trucks back there
Also do we need a mentor to clean the water jet, or else why are we waiting until 6?
We don't know who all intends to attend so we can't set up shifts
If we don’t know when were working, then we don’t know how to plan our out evening and won’t be able to attend.
When will we know what shifts we're working?
Can someone share the shifts spreadsheet so we know what time we are specifically working?

I thought we only had to sign up if we were at that school meeting
Are we cleaning the water jet right after school or normal meeting time?
Every one just needs to take a 10 min shift plz plus if you don't have clothes you can just cart the garnet out and there's no need to get dirty
Ohhh k cool
Kristina has a spreadsheet
Shifts 
Wait so how are 60 people going to fit into the shop
I heard Tipton say that today and Tuesday's meetings were both postponed
Just a heads up EVERYONE is expected to clean the water jet 
Please come help clean
Yes but still cleaning 
I think I heard Tuesday? Dunno
I heard postponed today, but not Tuesday
So Tipton canceled the meeting today and on Tuesday specifically
Yeah, you should also forward that email to them.
They had already filled it out so we had emails for them. 
Wasn't the survey also for cleaning the water jet out, they should know from that too.
An announcement is going to be made today
But how do the freshmen know that
The official team meeting is cancelled but the cleaning of the water jet is still on
So how are we going to alert the freshman and some sophomores that the meeting tonight is cancelled? There has been an email sent out by Bowlin from Bernie Dorsey to the people who are in the FRC Team email, but I doubt that includes the freshmen, so unless Tipton does something, the freshmen still believe there is a normal team meeting tonight
Here's hoping
We don't know
Last time they didn't want to cancel two days in advance bc of rides for freshmen
Will Tipton allow cancellation if it's the morning of?
you got my hopes up
ahhh man
Just the cancellation
it should be dealt with i.e. an announcement made tomorrow morning?
like the whole thing
wait
We've just been informed that it should be dealt with tomorrow morning. I know that's short notice but it seems that it was the best that could be done. Nothing moves as quickly as we would like. As of now that is all we know. We will keep you posted as we learn more but for now hang tight until tomorrow.
Anything?
<@U1F6AR1NF> <@U27TQ5U7K> <@U1F09HT4N>
its the end of the day and the announcement was never made. Does anybody have information as to why?
<@U1JM7GF7E> has left the group
It has a box to tell me a fun fact about you too, something I use to learn the Freshman names.
Yeah. I’m reusing the survey from the Freshmen. 
But it has parent information
We are doing this to make a list of groups to clean. 
You made a commitment to helping clean out the water jet. 
It says that it's a sign up for RAHS FRC team
Wait did I just make a commitment by filling that out?
I just didn't really understand it, based on the situation at hand.
We were told that this decision got pushed off to a later date? Isn't this kind of pressuring kids to decide now?
Thanks
If you don't want to fill it out don't 
sorry
It doesn't help anyone
Don't pick fights please
Literally if you don’t want to be involved don’t fill it out. Simple as that. 
But at this moment this is the fastest way to get the info out. 
don't you have a slack for the other team
I mean that people who are currently at robotics right now need to. 
Do you mean that Izzie doesn't have to do it, or the team in general?
What does that mean?
You don’t have to do it. 
Isn't the deadline not for a while?

Reminder: The 4-H meeting is tomorrow at 6 at 2124 SW 146th St, Burien, WA. If anyone needs a ride, just let me know. There are plenty of mentors and parents willing to ferry students over. Hope to see you there!
Yeah my mom brought over two kids today (other than me and <@U1F0BGMLN>), and she said that if she gets to the school early enough she could do two trips to get more students 
I also have a seat for one more
Dm me if thats you
I can help give rides for people that can't make it to Burien.
Hey, so at the 4H Team meeting tonight, we wanted to give people who were still deciding where they wanted to go a chance to go to both team's meetings, So we decided to hold meetings on Mondays instead of Tuesdays at 6 - whenever. You can come earlier than 6, but be aware that it is the desilvas house they are volunteering up. Thursday meetings will be held at the same time as normal. Again the address is  2124 SW 146th St, Burien, WA. Thanks.
Yeah, I have been to/watched on the TV a lot of school board meetings before. Idk how we know if we made an impact, but I know that somehow people do get things done they that avenue
The desired solution being the school board placing pressure on the superintendent to solve the problem
Something like that
Ie a bunch of people showing up in skunk shirts
I could see it being possible to get support from the board with a show of solidarity from the team
^
Basically how it works is you get 4 min to say everything you want (they will ask you to stop when the 4 min is up) and then the next person goes 
I've never actually been to a school board meeting, but from what I understand people get an opportunity to speak and there is no response. If this is the case, I doubt our concerns will be heard any louder than they are at the building right now
There is a Highline school board meeting on Wednesday, October 4, during which students would be able to address the board for 4 minutes with concerns they have with the running of the team(s). I find myself hoping that this recent issue could be solved via intervention at a level higher than the school administration, and think that this could be an excellent opportunity for the team to band together.
Not yet
<@U1F0QEL0Z> has your dad brought the laptops back to the school yet?

what about :benton_irl: :alex_irl: &amp; :david_irl:
Should we make three teams 
seal!
I think it should go with vote, others think it should be at school
Deal or No Deal 
The problem is no one will agree on which way a United team should go.
wdym
I think we can agree right here that that's not the case
ok but for real, student meeting today just to make sure splitting is the direction we want to go?
That better be a real picture
sometimes people get hungry
Why?

I dont know how relevant the vote at the 4H meeting at the mof is now
I mean based on the latest poll the decision has been split almost perfectly into thirds
Izzie, while that is certainly true. How many people truly thought that the 4H team would have to disassociate from the school? Even now when the administration has stated pretty explicitly that it is not going to happen plans are in the works to go above their heads and try to force this to happen.
Altho we were pretty much shut down, we have more options 
True
We're not done trying to cooperate; I'm not done trying to cooperate at least
I mean it is the school saying the 4H team can't stay at the school
When we voted 4-H it was made clear students had to be willing to leave if admin wouldn't cooperate
Still havent had a team meeting with both sides represented and one is not being planned
i agree nathan
Then you voted on an option that didn’t exist, being 4H and staying at the school.  
but idk
imo we should have a student meeting to make sure this is what we want
Both of those are fair
We didn't vote to leave the school.
The first step was when there were two different meetings 
guys this conversation is not helping or getting anywhere
In my opinion, voting to leave the school was the first step to splitting 
i agree, but the option to go back to one team hasn't gone away
It's like the first step to splitting
I mean they do have a temporary number and name already
maybe we should make the final decision of whether or not we're splitting or not before we have this conversation
I agree with Eli - this conversation is oriented as if it's inevitable that the team will split 
I'd be down for that. It'd be LIT :fire:
Ohhhhh, just to piss off speech and debate we should rob a zoo then go to one of their meetings and set a penguin on fire
It would be good to truly be a part of the school
Sci oly too
Turbulences mascot is the Phoenix 
A flaming penguin is basically a weird Phoenix 
Exactly
Like Nathan said last night it seems like we're ignoring the problem instead of trying to solve it
I mean skunks were a school team and it wasn't school related. Speech and Debate's mascot is the flaming penguins
why are we focusing on how to split instead of how to resolve the issue
Since we’re a school team 
Tbd but probably 
It will be related to the schools mascot though 
Do we get to vote on what we want our team name/mascot to be?
Cool
Yep
A placeholder so that we could submit our first preference. We should be getting a number close to 1983 as well as veteran status because we are doing a separation of two teams not a rookie team. 
200800431 is hardly memorable
lol
hopefully on the number part lol
It’s a temporary name and number btw

He does matter if he is making robotics students feel unwelcome in his classes
I  hate to say it but in this case, while he is a dick, he doesn't matter rn.
Saying he thinks robotics students are selfish, rebellious, don't need mentors or that mentors design/build the robot, etc.
What did he say?
Yeah, he thinks its funny when he's a dick to robotics kids. Although when I talked to him a few days ago, he wasn't trying to be funny, just being a dick. I mean he apologized about it later, but in an offhand way.
It has nothing to do with Tipton, it is that Joshi thinks that's a funny thing to say when the robotics students are undergoing so much
I mean Joshi doesn't represent Tipton, but yeah he's pretty upset about whats going on.
I mean I got that from sat team 
wow, so joshi *is* a dick
It was inappropriate 
I don't understand. They say they're on our side then they say things like that in front of other students
He's been like that for a few days now
it was obviously made in a derogatory sense
just so you're all aware: Joshi isn't afraid to make disrespectful comments in front of other students about the robotics team. During second period (&lt;5 minutes ago) he said "It would be cool to have a student and parent teams for Flight by Design. Oh wait, that's called robotics."

FRIED CHICKEN 
Oh jesus that ended on a weird note
Hey Patrick, I'm a little late to the conversation because I had homework to do. But I'd like to tell you that Izzie was NOT the person who called that meeting. She might've been at the front of the room, the the Tuesday meeting was called by two boys from the Sunday meeting. I thought I should clarify that. 
Okay nite everyone 
go to bed
oh gahd
uh oh
I'm looking it up
Why
Lol nite everyone
BIG NASTYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
Gross
chicken
Fried?
fried
Seconded
So let's try not to kill each other
Goodnight! It sure will be great seeing you at school tomorrow, and for the next eight or so months!
*I am going to bed now*
Idk about you Henry, but I come from SPS, where that was a bit of a norm. I guess it doesn't seem strange to me that if admin is unwilling to consider our side we move up the chain
you are entitled to your own opinion
From what I know to be true, I feel that this is unwise
This isnt a personal attack merely a warning
It seems to me that going above their heads is not somthing that has been fully thought out
now its ad hominem
Reckless: (of a person or their actions) without thinking or caring about the consequences of an action.
You called it a reckless course of action
Your most recent one
Which one
Yeah...
I challenge you to rewrite that statement without placing blame
Good point, except I think everyone else is asleep
I have stated the facts. I have stated the consequences. All that remains is to decide whether you wish to peruse the reckless course of action. I challenge you to think of it from their perspective even if you disagree. I am not the enemy here, we all just want what is best for the team
the conversation may have moved on by that point
Someone's there to defend, just maybe in the morning
that's fair I guess
it's not about the notifications, it's about the fact you would be making claims without anyone being here to defend 
that's not really fair though 
Like I said, you can respond whenever you want
Seriously tho we arent going to get anywhere with this, we should really go to bed
I want to stay positive, but I will note that I did not sense compromise coming from admin in other respects. Admin also tried to convince the students that they were wrong with the coaching decision and the time changes
there never had to be if they had let us have time to work things out. I understand that it would be short notice for the freshmen, but I think that could have been worked around
To attempt to go above the heads of the administration is to loose any good will still left. They already feel circumvented and cut off by this entire process and to do so again so blatantly to do what they want is a sure fire way to ensure that it will never become a possibility. This is a view that has even been expressed by members of the administration, strictly off the record.
what makes me so mad is that there is "another team operating there"
Compromise is viewed very different ways by different people and to state that the only solution that would constitute a compromise is one where 4H is the team at the school is to confuse the issue. I would challenge you to point to an unwillingness by the administration to work with the students to address their concerns and visions for the team, that still provides plenty of leeway for concession. I would highly encourage you to meet with Tipton to address these maters in a non-hostile way. You state that you claim that you are more than happy with the school administration retaining much of the control that they currently have and there are absolutely ways to do that in a non-4H way. 4H is not the only option to compromise. You state that they are unwilling to come to the table to discuss the option of compromise but I would rebut with that is exactly what they have been doing. We have been meeting with them constantly in the past week and we have started to make real progress and getting things confirmed in writing. The issue is that the administration feels to go 4H is to entirely to lose any sort of control that they currently possess. And while you note that it is the district that the contract is ultimately signed with, they will not blatently disreguard the wishes of the school. Especially if there is another team already opperating there.
That explains it
Yeah... Found that out when I stopped getting slack notifications randomly....
just an fyi for everybody, you can autosnooze notifications after a certain time in the day so that you won't get notifications while you're sleeping.
its thursday now, 0011 hours
Nathan it is tomorrow
Shh the children are sleeping
tipton says she is for the *students,* so now that the *students* have voted she wont consider our ideas
perhaps we continue this tomorrow ?
which is not what the *students* decided they wanted
That does not give much leeway at all for any concession
But administration right now has taken the stance that the only possible team to exist at the school is one run by the school.
her idea of "what is best for the students" is also exactly what she has in mind, exactly what she wants, and exactly what she expects. it seems less and less reasonable that she wants to make any sort of compromise every time she turns us down
You may say that compromise would be letting go the option of 4H; Ok! I'm fine with that! Lets discuss the possibilities about how the team may move forward for the coming year and years to come.
I agree with Eli, tipton seems very sure that she wants to make no concessions
We have been flat out denied the opportunity to discuss what it may mean for the school, for the future of the team, and for the future of the _students_ that want to take part in robotics. From my point of view, I am more than happy with the school administration retaining much of the control that they currently have; but I personally would like to work out terms so that news about changes isn't so sudden. That's personal; what matters right now is the ability to come to the table and compromise. I feel like we haven't been given the opportunity to do so.
Alrighty then...
However, you can't deny that administration has flat out denied requests to compromise and find an inbetween. So far I have seen no concession from the administration on that point. Someone may try to bring up (again) that we have a similar stoic point: No. We wish to discuss the possibilities and what it would take to form an MOU, and what those terms would be. Do we want to hold a discussion about that? Yes. Will we compromise if we ever discuss the possibility? Yes, it's a memorandum of understanding, not a lets use the facilities and demand that we run the team the way we want.
Feel free to respond whenever you'd like
Eli I really do not wish to debate the merits of that with you right now, can we all go to bed now and address that tomorrow
I understand that going over people's heads is often not the best option
<@U1F6AR1NF> school admin has made it clear that the option that is best for the team isn't going to work for the school. The district has the final authority over everything that happens in the district; if we come to an MOU with the district than we may still be able to work out a solution that is best for both "sides"
Yeah I'm gonna go pass out now, and by that I mean go on reddit on my phone for like an hour
Fair
Nothing else is going to get done here tonight. Lets all try to be awake tomorrow
Gudor said that the "other team will 'go away'"
Lol <@U1F0BJN5U> 
Same to you!
Go to bad y'all
happy 9/28 everyone
Well 4-H says MOA with district...
Yes, pissing them off sounds like a swell idea...
To try to go over Tipton's head
I understand some people are emailing school board members and the superintendent 
<@U1F6AR1NF> pinned their Word Document <https://skunkworksteam1983.slack.com/files/U1F6AR1NF/F79HCTYHF/september_27th_morning_meeting_with_tipton_-_edit.docx|September 27th Morning Meeting with Tipton.docx> to this channel.
Give me a second to find the relevant passage
I read it
Unless we are sponsored by the school and not 4H they have said it aint happening. I encourage you to read the meeting transcript
Or will it only happen under mysterious circumstances with shady deals made in dark rooms
Have gudor/Tipton said anything specific about 1983 returning to being affiliated with the school?
because I do, indeed, judge the fudge
Its solid
I still like mine <@U1F408NA0>
Lol :joy::joy:
izzie the wizzie
no worse than <@U1F0P4FA5> :grin:
eh, its fine
Lol
side note i see now that <@U1F0M8ZTP> is super pretentious and i should try to change that
then please explain what is
Not at all
That is not true <@U1F0M8ZTP> 
so what's more valuable to you <@U1F0P4FA5>? That 34.3% of students get to do a 4H team outside of school or that all of us can stay as one team?
That's not a compromise
We can either merge the 2 teams back into one or transition skunk works back to school run and get rid of the other team. Both options would require school sponsorship, but they would like to be clear that that option is available.
Admin said no to 4-H in school
What options?
Administration has made it clear that they are willing persue those options, the question is, are we?
That is true
registration doesn't end this discussion, there is still options avalible to us to become united again
I still want one meeting with both sides
To both <@U1F0QEL0Z> and <@U1F6AR1NF> 
True
We all agree on that but we still cannot come to some form of agreement on which of the two teams is the better option
If a team has already been registered, then this conversation wasn't necessary to begin with.
Well while we are working with Tipton we can't change it without her
 ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
this conversation was never about how undecided people would pick a team, it's that maybe two teams isn't the right option 
Exactly
If you go to the 4h meeting tomorrow, you can go to the RAHS one tuesday
I mean they take place at the same time so like its not possible
i'd say different days
I don't think people can attend both Thursday meetings though, I'm not sure if that's what you mean or not Izzie
both
I would like to attend both and probably have one meeting with both sides as well
<@U1F0QEL0Z> pinned a message to this channel.
YES
I think the best way for undecided people to make up their minds isn't with another student meeting, but by simply attending both meetings and seeing what they like better. They should pick a team for how it runs, not what their friends tell them.
Guys this was never about us. Each side wanted what was best for them. This was never truly our decision this was whoever could voice their opinions the loudest. Personal thoughts 
real decision
real options
If people have registered a team, I think that's pretty cool
what?
I don't know if this is a bad feeling, but that's pretty neat.
I agree
imo i think we should have another student meeting just so the undecided people can see both sides without having to worry about reading 2000 slack msgs 
Idk ask Ailis, shes the one who said it happened
but mr. gudor said that  we can "make that team go away" if the team decides to back away from 4H
ooooooooohhhh what's their number?
yes
maybe it's too late 
i believe that another teams been registered, no?
what do we do? how do we fix what's happened
Even at the parent meeting. Mrs. Tipton attempted to speak out a couple of times and was torn apart by parents unwilling to accept what she was saying. I do not know what meeting you were at if you couldn't tell she wasnt on the verge of tears. I agree she could have stood up for herself but she was going up against some pretty overwhelming odds with neither gudor or wilson to back her up either
the one that happended yesterday
That's fair, that's why I talked with Henry about the option of staying at school so now I'm firmly on the fence because now I know more about both options
what? no the parent meeting over a week ago now
It became dominated by 4H parents and mentors and with nobody from the school administration, and with Mrs. Wilson afraid to speak, wild accusations flew around unchecked and in the end we made the decision with leadership of only really half of the options present
if people are already set on 4h, this entire conversation served no purpose 
ok, thanks for letting me know 
not everyone
both parties can be present but never in equal standing, one is always outweighed by the other and the people present affect the points that are made
it was too soon, but that was a meeting that happened with everybody
That was supposed to be the idea of the meeting on tuesday but that wasn't what ended up happening
I agree with that Henry. Mostly by parents and mentors. Mentors probably won't apologize for that either
<@U1F0W3FFC> parent meeting on tuesday
i confirm, <@U1F0W3FFC>
And can we all just agree that Mrs. Wilson was treated very unfairly. She was terrified to speak out after she got torn apart for simply speaking up. Thats why she left.
the irreversable decision was made when izzie said that there would be a meeting on thursday. I do not want to criticize her, but i feel that the calling of that meeting symbolizes the start of two teams and now we have to choose
there has never been a meeting where there are both parties present to my knowledge, someone confirm?
because every meeting was weighted in favor of one or the other. on tuesday, we didnt know what 4H was, so we disregarded it. on sunday, all of the adults there were hugely in favor of 4H, and so we wanted 4H. last night, coach and the mentors were all in favor of 4H. i can say personally I did not feel comfortable speaking against 4H and commend harrison for his bravery to stand up and speak against the mentors, even though i was undecided then and am undecided now
well it might already be made nvm 
Who should apologize to who, who didn't apologize to who in a reasonable time frame, is this reasonable, can the mentors say that, can the administration do this, can we vote on that
then why don't we wait before making an irreversible decision 
We don't even know what the problems are; that's what we're arguing about right now
nobody is trying to say that we shouldn't try to fix what's going on
nobody is trying to say there aren't problems
They're undecided and uninformed, not childish
<@U1F0W3FFC> nobody is trying to avoid the problems
4H or you are against the team and personally driving a knife into the heart of coach feels like how it has been portrayed
There are adults who swing back and forth
why can't we just address the problems that we're having instead of completely avoiding them?
Because we haven't made a final decision yet it makes us childish? That's insane logic
i went to every one and switched every time
nothing against a 4H meeting but it felt biased from the start
and they still switched
because I know people who went to every one
the sunday meeting felt like a 4H orgy from the start and nobody there spoke against it
I think it shows that we are still kids
exactly
and who felt invited
I think that is in part indicitive of who was able to go
exactly.
tuesday: lets stick with the school. Sunday: lets go 4H. Tuesday: Lets stick with the school. Tuesday: Lets go 4H.
every single meeting that there was student attendance at, the feel of what was going to happen how flipped 180 degrees
Hardly seems like leaving the team on equal footing
The vote was called basically with the last word coach crying....
wtf???
imagine if you only got to hear one candidates campaign speech before voting 
how are you going to let a room full of adults influence our opinions literally 15 minutes before we vote, with nobody to defend the claims they're attaching?
yeah everyone is so hostile to her and expects us to be treated with the utmost respect
the mentors used themselves and their connections as bargaining chips. it felt so wrong
We're criticizing her for not apologizing to Thomas, when the mentors/parents won't apologize either
i definitely saw that
if nobody else sees this, i don't want to have anything to do with anything related to skunkworks, 4h or no 4h
the fucking mentors of our team accused her of being a liar, a hypocrite, and being hard to deal with, while at the same time threatening us that if we stay with the school we would lose our business partners (first of all, what??) and that they would all leave 
It's ridiculous the technicalities she's used to enable her to claim that there are 2 teams right now. There don't have to be at all. We attempted to work it out so that there wouldn't be a split meeting. They said no. We had the meeting, then they said that there are 2 teams now and we have to choose
i dont see how that is such a big problem for her
there does not need to be two teams if the one at the school was 4H
I mean at the meeting, 2/3 said they wanted 4H, and now only 1/3 want 4H
That is just *wrong*
That was hardly her only response, She also said there is already a team of students at the school and she cannot allow both to remain
and if we weren't on tuesday?
I mean that statement isn't inaccurate
She responded "You guys were influenced by other parties at a meeting on Sunday"
From what I understand, we let Tipton know that the students decided that 4H is the direction we wished to take, and that we wanted to continue partnership with the school and work out a solution best for both parties
And she is actually working with us now...
where was the communication before the incident? nonexistent 
after the fact of our mentor being kicked, sure
We've been talking to tipton for days about what we want
the problem is that tipton doesn't know what "the kids" want 
There are robotics teams of only students
even though we're just kids it's obvious that all of tiptons decisions are made in the best interest of "the kids"
r/im14andthisisdeep
You also cant have a robotics team of only mentors
hey I'm still 12 so I have a little mah ture en to do still
can't have an FRC team of only students
I hate to break it to you but we aren't really kids any more...
Can't have an FRC team of only mentors
Who cares if we're kids, the kids are the team
I mean we are "just kids"
So mentors are ignoring what happened because of their feelings? Because of their bias towards Tipton even though she listens to students and is actively trying to be better?
everyone keep singing "its all about the students" and we are the ones being fucked
thats the part that I cant get past
we have stood up a lot and if they dont see that why are we the ones who suffer
I don't see that either, but that is how they feel
its not avoiding the problem. We presented a solution that we believe would fix the problem, and solve others along the way. They said take the highway.
I don't see how we haven't stood up for the mentors
then why don't we fix it?! how is avoiding the problem altogether fix the problem 
?
But thats exactly what we did for Thomas
the mentors have expressed that they don't feel the students will really stand up for them
doesn't garuntee it won't happen again
She certainly learned that lesson the hard way.
Isn't the system for mentors to feel protected through the students? So far it seemss Tipton has learned her lesson about trying to kick off mentors, and that the students will stand up to her and protect the mentors.
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
slack ruins lenny
quite the long face there
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
rofl
"succ"
"suck it up"
"Gudor feels as though the team is not student run enough. 
Challenges the mentors to suck it up and support the students either way the decision works out. 
"
i have no knowledge of a mentor attempting to speak to tipton other than thomas 
Through her open door
that was directed towards mentors. Thomas DeSilva was removed from the team for voicing his concerns.
To my experience, I have yet to find a time when that is not the case eli
"our team simply cannot run effectively"
One of the things we really should work with her towards that hasn't really been touched is mentor safety the question is now what sort of reassurances do the mentors require that would allow all of them to feel safe
"my door is always open to you" is it really?
"The mentors role on the team should be to help the students not to do administration"
I understand she is making an effort, but it's still not nearly enough
it's not tipton, it's the lack of a process
it's not that they can't feel comfortable, it's that there are no systems in place to make them feel comfortable 
you're right, it hasn't been discussed, but it happened anyway
<@U1F6AR1NF> uploaded a file: <https://skunkworksteam1983.slack.com/files/U1F6AR1NF/F79HQQ6RX/pasted_image_at_2017_09_27_11_08_pm.png|Pasted image at 2017-09-27, 11:08 PM> and commented: Internet it how you will, while it isn't anything that hasn't been said before let me just put out there what she said in her email:
mentors can't feel comfortable under tipton
there's never been a system in place for the principal to have a say in which mentors can come 
i don't think it's ever been discussed
That is not at all an accurate representation of what she has said patrick
that's not entirely true 
tipton is adamant that she wont allow a program at the school where mentors feel comfortable
because we did and it was rejected
because neither side will budge
why can't we come up with a solution that doesn't invoke a split 
you're assuming that the only way the mentors will work with us is if we go 4h though 
I mean it seems like with student input we were able to get Thomas back at the school, ignoring the point of his hurt feelings.
I can grow old with my friends, but when is the point I don't have access to the mentors? 2 years, for others 1,3,4 years left. Then that's pretty much it, then what I learn in college will be as much as they can give me.
same 
I'm assuming that's rhetorical at this point
imo it's not that she removed thomas, it's that the mentors realized that she had the power to remove anyone she wanted at any time. they realized there was no protection for them, and the 4h would be the best way to ensure that that cannot happen again. why can't we just solve this issue while staying as a singular team at the school? 
I feel that way too! Mr weeks has taught me so much and I really value his input but I would be appalled if he told me that he wouldnt stay at the school and teach me and henry because mrs tipton removed thomas desilva for a total of less than 24 hours
i do feel like although the mentors need to be considered, they became far too crucial in people's decision making... mentor-based, not mentor-run
To me the mentors have made the most impact on what I want to do for my career.
not out loud, yet...
nobody is branding you a traitor
its fine if you think that i just want to know what the truth is.... who do we prioritize?
Cad I should amend, I have learned cad from other students
Exactly, loathe as I am to agree with anything the administration said and be branded as a _traitor_ by the team. I agree with Mr. Gudors point in the meeting this morning which is that I feel the outcome of the meeting could have looked very different last night if the students did not feel that the mentors would only respect the outcome and stay with the team if the team voted 4H
(I would argue Tucker) yes, yes, maybe, no
so the mentors are more important than the students?
I can't learn from other students how to do cad or how to program or how to use the shop or how to stress test
Much fair points
:thinking_face:
If the students are really the most important part of the team then why are the students being split just so the mentors can all stay together?
while we can attempt to be purely objective, that doesn't matter when a person doesn't feel welcome. whether that's a petty decision or one that shouldn't affect the team, it has and it will, and I don't believe the blame should be put on the mentors for that
We'll she never apologized or said sorry about Thomas DeSilva
or saying she was wrong in any way
she did so without apologizing
To present the most direct counter point to that, once it was evident that *The Students* wanted Thomas Desilva back, he was invited back within 24 hours. I would argue that they only really care about the input that the students provide. Not to say that they aren't controlling, and we still need to wary of Tipton just saying things and now following through with them. But if we can achieve more meetings with her with results in writing, like today. The issue of lack of control goes away. Again, I'm on the fence, and you bring up a very valid point but I want to ensure all views are represented.
I'm not saying you're wrong
To present the most direct counterpoint you can get, the school cares more about controlling the team than listening to anybody it seems like. I'm on the fence too, but I'm not comfortable with leadership that will directly lie to us, tell us we have a say, then say that our say was wrong.
The one thing I am very uncomfortable about with this notion that we will "lose the mentors", is the idea that the mentors care more about their perceived feeling after one extremely poorly handled reaction than then care about working with the students. I feel that the mentors that really feel that the students are the most important thing about the team wouldn't force the students to choose between options presented as "mentors" or "no mentors". While I am still on the fence I feel that at a certain point people need to push personal grievances aside, and really make a go of it. In all fairness they have treated the administration much worse. This is not to say they didn't deserve the outcry they recieved. But before the mentors choose to really leave they should ask what matters to them more.
it really doesn't matter, but I really don't have a year to wait on what way the team is going, that's my two cents
Do you literally mean you're building a house? I mean you have your vote and all, but that doesn't really apply to the rest of the team
we are in the process of getting a house up here, we can stop that and move back home. I don't have a year.
if it were that simple nobody would say "no that's a bad idea"
its not that simple
Tell that to the mentors
we lose the mentors
Guys this doesn't have to happen we can give it another year
I won't deny it. I just think people have to go with whatever they think will be best for them, and hope for the best, honestly.
if anyone is still denying that this is shattering the team then they are lying to themselves and everyone else
that is an almost exact split in thirds
thats fucking ridiculous
Holy crap that's close, like within margin of error. Especially since a few students haven't voted yet.
So does he not want any of the booster club money (which is in the bi-laws) if the 4H-team explodes? 
"Gudor states that once we break off from the school and become a 4H team, the team will not be able to come back to the school." 
I feel that this is something that should be clarified.

<@U1F0P4FA5> just to get an idea, what are the most recent survey results looking like right now

She has verified in writing the accuracy of all of these notes. Any questions or awkwardly phrased passages please direct your questions towards me or the other people at the meeting today (Me, David, Izzie, Evan, Erin).
I know I can't really mend the pain, but I'll say this, I know robotics isn't the only thing keeping friend ships together. You are friends because you've been at the same school, worked on the same projects, know the same people. It's a small school. It's up to all of us to keep our friends together. If someone is feeling bad, tell them that you are there for them. Who says we can't work together on the same things. Who says we can't make the same decisions. I will continue to be friends with everyone here, because I know who they are as people. Robotics may have introduced me and set up my friendships, but it's mine, and in effect, our choice to keep them as friends. If it's the president I vote for, or the team I root for, or the robotics team I'm apart of. I will never let that get in the way of just being able to talk to someone, ask them how their day is going, ask them how their project is going, ask them what they are planning on doing for the robot. They are still my friend. If they choose to push you away, it's not your decision, it's them not being able to accept you for who you are. I can't stress enough how important it is for all of us, to come together in more than just robots; Because that is what this is all about, more than just robots.
and I hate using their names but this is the situation I've been put in
I have to choose in the near future whether I want to be on a robotics team with Eli or a robotics team with Henry. They are my best friends and I have loved being on skunkworks with them both and now I have to chose which teammate I want
Tucker, we went to katsu burger and had a nice dinner yesterday. now that might not happen anymore
which is why you shouldn't let them tear your friendships apart
and by me and my friends i mean all of you too!
But its me and my friends who pay the price. Principals and mentors and coaches and parents all keep talking about how "Its about the students" and yet all of us are the ones being *forced to suffer*
it really doesn't have to be this way
I think we should all remember, whatever choice we choose, who did this to us. it's not our friends who did this.
I know that whatever meeting I go to will not be my final choice
I don't see how we can be happy in the end. I'm sorry to sound pessimistic, but I feel like now I have to decide which friends I want keep. There's no way that there won't be animosity between the two teams. The lunch table I sit at consists of almost all Skunkworks students and I know that not all of us will join the same team. Is anyone going to seriously tell me that if that after our robotics team splits, my friend group wont? Can anyone seriously tell me that everyone who was friends before this will stay friends no matter what team we join? Most of us are friends *because* of this!

I just cried my eyes out, I feel like I want to throw up, I feel like I'm having to choose between my best friends, and there's no way that we are all going to come out of this better off. I know I'm not going to be happy in the end, and I can't imagine anyone being happy with this split.
I hope no matter what happens or if/where we all go, I hope we are all happy and can do robotics. We are all a family and it's sad to see the split but if we all happy in the end, that's what matters the most 
And I do truly believe that
we will all come out of whatever this fiasco was, together and stronger
I don't think people should feel sick, we are all friends in the end
Coopertition, right?
<@U1F0P4FA5> pinned a message to this channel.
do what feels best for you, you will still see everyone at school, on the field
How can I choose
i totally agree, it's sad that a family is being disassembled with such ease and we shouldn't allow it to happen
I know
I know, it's still sad 
it's the admin
Yeah, me too
It's not the students that are forcing this
and I know its not final but I actually feel sick to my stomach
it makes me sick to think that we're already splitting into groups
Sorry it's so formal, I pretty much copy and pasted the email I wrote 
@channel The DeSilva's have graciously agreed to host the 4-H team meeting tomorrow night from 6-8 pm. This will be a student and mentor meeting, as many team meetings have been in the past, and the focus will be on working out our season details. The address is 2124 SW 146th St, Burien, WA. Carpools are encouraged, so if your parents are driving you, ask if there is room in the car to take more students to the meeting. If anyone has trouble making it to the meeting for transportation reasons, please let me know. Please RSVP if you are coming!
P.S. I understand that some students are not getting these emails, so please pass the message along.
If anyone is staying with the school and would like to stay informed we have a group chat. Let me know if you want to join. Anyone can join but we'll be planning the school team so you'll just get spammed? Up to you tho. 
Okay, we are at 24 responses! I think that means 14 more people need to fill out the survey
Okay, I only have 17 responses. Plz fill out survey! <http://goo.gl/forms/HHtpgvxy2R1EgRbr2>
Ok, sounds good
About their options for teams
Ok
About...?
To the RAHS practice to talk to them, in an unbiased manner. 
To talk to the freshmen
Going where izzie?
<@U1F09HT4N> is going tomorrow
if there is a 4H team, would they be able to talk to the freshman about it, maybe going up at a meeting and talking about the options? I understand if the RAHS team doesn't want it to pull kids away, but giving them an option too would be the most fair decision imo.
I am asking for students to make a decision by the end of October, at least in regards to the RAHS team. And our coaches didn’t think that was unreasonable. 
thats with the assumption that there are two teams though
mainly just in build season
Exactly
But I think that if someone joined either side, was there for a month, and decided it wasn't for them, they could choose to go back. Neither team will be large enough that it would be an issue
Yes, I agree
At some point I feel a student should pick, because if other people on either side rely on that person, It's not fair to either if they are constantly just giving 50% to each side.
Can you clarify?
Not saying "oh let's switch back and forth every day", more on the lines of things that are imperative now that the school can bring while the 4h get's a better footing
that's if we decide that there will for sure be a 4h split though. i don't think that until we're absolutely 100% certain we're splitting we should talk about the nature of how a 4h team would function. it's not healthy for the atmosphere imo
Kids can change their minds after eventually picking. I don't think either side would exclude them
Also, if the split it made will kids be able to switch later on? Because I know some people were wanting to stay because of stuff like smelly, but if they could stay at school, then join the 4H I think that would be a lot better for everyone.
just a thought, but coach brought up a great point that no matter what happens, if we have the same 1/3 vs 2/3 division either team won't survive, 4h or non-4h
basically nothing is final yet so please keep your options open. 
How much time?
People have time to make up their minds
and will not
ok, just making sure
no it should not
No, not at all
just curious
are you saying that which meeting we attend tomorrow decides our future on the team?
On that note izzie, is there two meetings tomorrow again?
We just need to know who will be at which meeting
not saying anyone is saying that
i totally agree
exactly nathan
burning bridges saying we're kicking people isn't very productive imo
Nothing is final yet, but it remains that there are two meetings tomorrow
seems like everyone is certain that the team is splitting into 4h/non-4h, to my understanding nothing is final yet
<@U1F0QEL0Z> pinned a message to this channel.
I completely agree, not saying I've been the nicest I could, but I will be and have been trying to move towards that
Just wanted to throw this out here: can we please act a bit more professional, and respect each other and use a bit nicer wording? I'm not specifically saying this about a particular person but just in general. People who are less outspoken aren't going to want to share their opinion which is important, if they feel as though they will get shut down or people will be rude to them. I really think we need to have a better attitude about this and try to be mature and kinder to eachother about all that's happened. This is tough on all of us but it's not going to resolve ourselves if both sides are being rude to eachother. (Again just a general idea)
payton nothing's hostile about it we just need a meeting space and to be able to tell who's moving on. There's no judgment or anything we just need to know
how so?
This seems a little hostile like I gave my name but it just seems stupid. 
Probably before build season
On another point, when does it have to be final?
But I thought it wasn't final?
going to have to give names anyways at some point
Well, if this is the slack that stays with the team, I also need to know who to remove.
could also be used for a finale list
Why do we need to input our full names? I mean this is just my personal opinion, but I just kind of feel like if you're just trying to get a generalization for how big of a meeting space you need to have you don't necessarily need to have our name 
Hey everyone, seeing as we need to determine how much room we need in a new meeting space, we need to know how many students may come with the 4H team. Please fill out the following survey. No one will be discriminated against for their choice, we just need to know. It is also perfectly fine to be undecided, and that is included as an option.

I  can’t get the museum for Thursday, so if someone else has a location that’d be pretty cool
We are most likely not meeting at the school on Thursday. However, it is my understanding that negotiations will continue
That second sentence didn't make sense
I mean only thing stopping us from meeting at the school on Thursday is Tipton decision
We shall see what Tipton says, then make the decision
I don't think that everybody is on the same page. What is the intention for the meeting? I think we need to start having much clearer agendas
Thursday?
woo more meetings
Agreed 
i think we should have another student meeting to talk about the future of the team and make sure everyone is on the same page
I think it's for sure time soon to talk about things
I don't think that's unreasonable given that he hasn't completed his research
Which he agreed to
Well I have asked him to keep quiet until he releases the article
Especially not a parent
Cause timo has every right to talk at this point, nobody can ask him not to
yep
Oh do you mean to non-robotics members?
maybe another student meeting ?
Like just in general talking to people and allowing ourselves to talk about the situation
I mean telling people what's happened
What do you mean by talking to the rest of the school? For now we are setting up a meeting with Ms. Tipton for tomorrow
I have arguments for and against
Are we still not talking to the rest of the school about this?
For students who were not at the meeting, it was moderated by a group of four students (myself, <@U1F1395TK>, <@U27TQ5U7K>, and <@U1F6AR1NF>), as well as by Mr. Wright. It was decided in a student vote that the "team" would begin work towards becoming a 4H-sponsored team at the school. Currently a group of students is working to start talks with Ms. Tipton, and hopefully we will figure things out from there. No matter what happens, I hope that this is the beginning of healing and getting back to being a Skunk Family. 
So who is going to upload notes/transcripts from tonights meeting?

Everyone remember: there is a meeting in Gudor's after school to hear what he has to say about tonight's meetings.
Nah just Tipton
Shouldn't we set the channel topic to something relevant like "Speak your mind if it's relevant to the entire team" or something
heyy that doesn't sound unreasonable
noice
WE DID IT 
<@U1F6AR1NF> pinned a message to this channel.
Hey all, David and I just talked with Mrs. Tipton. While it was a very brief meeting there were a number of important takeaways from it. 
1) No retribution whatsoever of any sort will be brought upon any students, mentors, or parents that attend the meeting tonight. 
2) Her explicitly stated preference is to continue with the team as it is right now. 
3) She made it clear that the team splitting is the least preferable option to her and that one person will not be enough to split the team. 
4) While it was not stated outright it is clear to us that the only way that she will accept the decision to go 4H is if it is the one that the STUDENTS make. We as the students will then need to be the ones who present it to her and make the decisions about it. 
5) If 4H is the option that we choose we will be able to use the shop, although in what capacity will have to be negotiated in the 4H agreement. 
6) She repeatedly stated that she wants whatever is best for the students.
Just click show channel details and look at the pinned items
If there is important to say then pin the message so then they're separate and you don't have to scroll through them, otherwise it's fine to just talk on here as much as you want.
Okay I think talking about talking too much is defeating the purpose of the conversation, so are we good?
This group chat is like reading the terms and conditions
You are freaking out more than he is
Lol sorry couldn't help myself
:face_with_rolling_eyes: ok I'm trying defend you izzie but thanks 
Payton are you insane
It was 8:33...
Ok Isaac, one that was rude af. Two, would you rather have us have a private group chat where we talk about everything? So that everyone is left in the dark like before? Sure it can get a little annoying but there's so much we need to talk about and I'd rather have everyone have a fair and equal chance to participate than a back room meeting like before. Honestly dude you need to chill out. That didn't help anyone and just got me pissed. It's not even 8:30 in the morning. Chillllllllllll tf out
<@U1F6AR1NF> pinned a message to this channel.
I need you all to understand something. You can't act like when you put a message here, you're whispering to one individual person. Everyone on the team gets these messages. Every little thing you put here goes to everyone. If you don't have something important as fuck to say and you put it here, you've just made everyone who looks through here trying to find something important read YOUR message. The vast majority of messages here are completely useless. I know I'm not the only one sick of clicking the notification on slack and having to scroll through 200+ messages looking for the one that has any meaning. Stop making us dig through the stack of half hay half SHIT looking for the one God damn needle.
Students who wish to hear from Gudor/Wilson before the off-campus meeting tonight should go to Mr. Gudor's room after school
<@U1F0QEL0Z> set the channel's topic: just tipton
<@U1F1ETJM7> set the channel's topic: apparently more than just robots meant a _lot_ more than we were expecting
much meetings
Mr. Wright has brought up Skunk Works mission on website (which should be included in meeting next to FIRST mission and RAHS mission) (confirm)
I can confirm
Oh okay can someone else?
I didn't really catch that part
Coach is saying that 4H is good for district to develop a unified policy on how FRC teams are run, so we should run the same way as high teckerz and ramen (confirm)
Sorry I misunderstood the what we were seconding on 
I'm confirming what's being said
I totally agree and we need to get it in writing (im not here, but just added my opinion)
But I believe she will do that 
No 
Ohhh man party in the library
Wait Payton you are here?
Get it in writing 
Confirm
Yes. 
Again can someone else second
Parents are concerned about the possibility that Tipton is only giving us the booster club for now bc she is under pressure, but she might rescind later (as she has tried to do with meeting times)
Yes
and wow that's a step in the right direction
here is the the email^^^
Confirmed
Yeet
Someone else confirm
Sounds like Tipton reluctantly agreed to allow booster club to run spaghetti dinner?
<https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nPaKPoRuwReIZ1nZImXxt9IZeUsfp0r67sdrZDl7zjo/edit?usp=sharing>
yes, sounds good.
Ok sounds good can we not spam this chat anymore 
guys this conversation is going to get nowhere. we will discuss all of this tomorrow night at the musuem of flight
So what mentor would want to waste their time if they could just be pushed out at any second
Right but again all she can do is remove people
But it happened 
That has been revoked
It cuts out Tipton from doing anything
Thomas was banned
What retribution? They’re volunteers not employees 
And they don't want to be stressed like that
Mentors are afraid of retribution
hold on, lets just read the email. ill attach it right now
Wait so they’re going to leave... bc they are scared of leaving?
We have better ability to choose meeting times
Mentors will leave if they don't feel safe
Mentors feel safe
Greater autonomy 
Insurance
Someone summarize the benefits of 4h
But I need to wait until after meeting
Yeah
Idk how to attach it
you could ask Jim Smith about that, isn't he at the booster club meeting?
Apparently the email lists are broken 
Just attach it here
I didn't?
Lots of people didn't
Someone forward it!
Well shoot
Same
 I didn't get an email from david
I will meet everyone at the Anderson statue 
Yes. 
Yes
Is the rbc the place the sat and ap tests were held?
There's fire everywhere and no one knows how to put it out. It seems like every liquid is gasoline 
rbc= red barn classroom
which is what was said in the email
At RBC
There was a lot of discussion and then it was decided that we would do what we planned initially
Do that
No
Did u read email
Someone give me a tldr
Lol
Holyyy balls 
But I thought the two emails would be unrrelated
I have
no i thought you were emailing gudor and wilson first
Have u sent out the email yet?
just saying that the meeting tomorrow is at the red barn classroom at 6pm at the MOF because some people aren't getting the emails so spreading the word as much as possible it good
What do u mean?
Not really related...
whoever is at the booster club meeting, could you please bring up the location for the meeting tomorrow?
<@U1F0QEL0Z> set the channel's topic: MAKING THIS TEAM NOT EXPLODE
My phone is screwy
Okay, I will once I get into a wifi zone
okay then izzie can you write them email to gudor and wilson then asking to meet with them after school at least before 6 so we can hear (and listen and learn) their thoughts and opinions?
Ok you probably have the most info here 
Again, <@U1F0P4FA5> here
It's not telling him what to do
 ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
It's to us
It isn't to Tipton 
This is different
Idk I wouldn’t run the risk of making them feel hijacked again
Not run by him
Not for our location for an off campus meeting
For cancelling meetings
Gudor was very clear that we need to run emails by him first 
So parents and mentors know
We need to get location out first
This is <@U1F0P4FA5> 
No location won't change either way
Yes
okay so should would email them before emailing the skunk family about the location?
At this point the only thing to do is ask them
^
ask them
yeah exactly. do you think the students meeting with them after school is enough?
Last time we did that we alienated them and members of our team
But I agree we need to involve the interim coaches before making a decision 
I can get y’all in the side of the barn
and say take your pick
i'd just say that there are two
also <@U1FAR4AJU> where are we entering...from the outside or the inside?
i feel like we need to reach out and email gudor and wilson before emailing everyone else? or not and should i just say that the location for tomorrow’s meeting is the red barn classroom
david why did you abstain
who is gonna make the email? 
Sounds good
we inform parents mentors and the like in this email
*so we are going to have parallel meetings, at school and at red barn and gudor and wilson will have a meeting with us before the main meetings start so that everyone get's a say, choose what you want to do (talk to new kids, or go talk about future stuff)*
Yes 
and what is fo shizzle
Izzie can't get wifi or data
gimmie two secs
Please reiterate the decision for folks who don't want to trawl through a mile of text
No data
<@U1F0P4FA5> says fo shizzle 
<!channel>
we all good in the hood with the decision ? 
i thought that was what we decided?
so same deal that we started with?
so have we notified the parents and mentors of the final location and have we requested to meet with gudor and wilson after school? 
Mostly parents
I know it was both our parents and our mentors advising us
He did not specify bc he doesn't know
Parents. Mentors. 
Which adults in particular 
Why do you think they are pushing back so hard on us meeting and figuring out 4h and what's going on? What's their skin in the game? They don't want to stay on as permanent coaches, they made that clear by saying they were interim coaches. They're manipulating us by saying our parents of all people don't care for our best interest. I don't think we can go into a meeting assuming the best of them either. 
the adults being the mentors and parents?
He said, and he admitted he might be totally wrong, that it seemed to him that the adults guiding us didn't have our best interests at heart
hmmm by who? alrighty so someone should write and email to the students and gudor and wilson asking to meet immediately after school
Maybe partially
So idk that he trusts us entirely to have our own opinions 
I would note that he also thought we were being manipulated...
we have to keep an open mind to new ideas and opinions
From what gudor said he seemed like he was legit trying to help us
exactly
we can’t go into this thinking they are the enemy 
True
Watch the time
We can say we have to go now
Well they can't stop you from walking away even if it's a little rude
After school is easier
They’re not plotting against us, they won’t prevent us from going to the meeting
no do it after school
But we have to be careful not to make up our minds without hearing all info (from Gudor/Wilson and from parents/mentors)
and maybe we even invite them to the meeting the museum of flight, and that way we made the gesture and if they don’t cancel the meeting they can’t come
Do it before school
If it's after school they could just keep talking and not let you go to the meeting
They can’t cancel the school meeting 
Okay
i think that is okay if they don’t come ONLY if we meet with them beforehand to hear their thoughts and opinions
I do agree they might not like that
You should meet beforehand, but not after school
Unless they cancel parallel meeting
Agreed
Well there's no other way to get them to meeting
Agreed
i agree bella
I think having them Skype will make them feel disrespected but idk that’s just my thoughts 
Also allowing them opportunity to skype in for small portion of meeting
Immediately after school might be good
I do want to once again reemphasize that gudor and wilson felt they wanted to be included so (if we aren’t going to go with thursday even though we should to allow for more communication) maybe should propose having a meeting with them and the students before school or during lunch or immediately after school tomorrow so they can talk with all of us and share their thoughts before we go to the museum of flight
Lol
do you guys have a group chat outside this because it seems like you all switched opinions in about 2 seconds (not being offensive just very confused)
<@U1F0BGMLN> seconded
*even though it is better
yes i did but we decided it won’t work as much as it is better
Another reason to have the meeting Tuesday is that I can tell a lot of us are super stressed, so acting quicker will get the stress out of the way quicker
Thurs won't work for deadlines or splinter group
wait didn't you just say that it need to be Thursday?
So everyone knows?
Can u send out an email?
Sounds good
guys this conversation is not going to get us anywhere i do think. we should refocus on getting everyone to the red barn classroom tomorrow night
That question should be added to google form
Excused absences can be handled
But if Gudor and Wilson aren't there the whole time I see no issue.
And if we don't go 4h, mentors will likely leave become of the hostile environment created by Tipton 
i'd be willing to go to court if she kicks me out. I feel like I would go to court for any students who are kicked out....
Isn't there the issue of robotics students not getting excused absences for events?
Exactly
Also if we decide to not go 4h mentors have already been kicked off for speaking out.
She can't kick y'all out of the school, but she can take you off the team. Suing is also expensive
?
and it should be completely disregarded 
yes but the people who are saying that are simply just trying to intimidate and manipulate us
Too
Sueing would take to long
if tipton kicks any of us out of the school, couldn't we just sue? what can she do to the students other than not allow the team to operate?
Agree with this
But not for the entire meeting
They would get a say
They don't care for the team, they are only interim coaches. They don't want to coach for the season. 
BC they are running parallel meeting
They would only be able to come part of the time
Okay, but there is also the bit about people fearing retribution from Tipton
If they skype, they can't shut us down 
I think they mainly care about the students who want to be on robotics, they said they didn't want to coach for hardly any time at all...
No because coach and Connie can come
But doesn't that defeat the purpose of having a meeting off campus?
Skype
That
We could invite them to skype in?
fine but how do we ensure that gudor and wilson feel welcome
Wednesday Meeting 
That too
wednesday night is the evening of learning, that doesn’t work
The point of the Tuesday meeting is nearly everyone can go
We can't have Wilson or Gudor there. By having them there, we will know that everything said will make its way back to Tipton, and kids will fear retribution. We need a day to voice ourselves to the mentors and be able to say what ever we want. 
The attendance would be far smaller
We could always do a Wednesday meeting the only question is who could attend.
Yeah. We need to make this decision before Thursday.
They have the right to an opinion
That's not fair
But we are preventing a splinter group from participating in FRC
exactly and by having both of these meetings we are involving the staff and the community 
And from what I know admin doesn't feel that way
And we need to involve the staff in those decisions 
We have deadlines on Thursday for grants and events. We need to make a decision on which way we are going before then
whoever they are (students), I believe that if they are informed, they will instantly realize the benefits to 4H and the school. No one at the school will have to worry about the safety of freshman and rides, the shop, having instructors at the school to facilitate people being there. I feel that if admin knew how much would be lifted off them, then I feel it's a no brainer.
yes but hopefully we can reduce the chance of that happening by having both meetings
Rn, those students who would leave are a part of our team
i feel like our first concern should be our own team right now
If we have a meeting on Thursday to decide 4H the other group may not have time to start its own FRC team
okay cool but i’m not sure that’s relevant to choosing meeting times here
The school wants to have a robotics team no matter what
did he give a reason why?
Gudor said regardless of if we become 4H in the school or outside, the school may wish to start a second team
well hopefully we could stay 4H in the school but otherwise exactly what tucker said
inform them about 4-H and hope they realize it's better?
But then what is the solution for the students who would leave skunk works if we turned 4H?
and it gives the freshmen more time to figure out rides home 
and the time can’t really be changed on the rbc meeting because mentors and parents are coming from work. which means that changing it to thursday solves that problem 
Gudor is concerned about getting freshmen rides home on short notice
Meeting time cannot be changed on the school meeting 
No
Start the school one earlier, (maybe 3:45 4:00) ?
could we just have the meeting at the RBC after the school one tomorrow?
i agree but this way it gives us time to coordinate everyone attending the off-campus meeting
it's either this team or they just "build" robots no FIRST at rahs
We need to make a decision in order to be fair to them
exactly
And that students who want a new team won't have time to make one
I guess it seems fine, but time is the main issue
I think they represent the students who want to join more than the teachers, they said they didn't want to be the ones who take over, just temporary.
okay but what are the thoughts on my idea up there^^^it seems like a way to make sure that gudor and wilson can express their thoughts and ideas about the team and that then we can go and discuss it on thursday
can also just report what happens, i'm not directly listening, but i'm here.
there is a robotics/ptsa meeting happening rn, tipton is here I'll ask when it's over if it wasn't discussed
Gudor seems to think that is impossible, but I keep hearing  Tipton is willing
We need to get that in writing or confirm it before we rely on that for decisions. 
somebody did and she said we could
(I don't know if this is rumor) I though I heard about someone asking tipton about having a 4-H team at the school (use the shop..) is that true?
Then if we go 4H the potential new team would have no chance to start a new team. Even if we don't like that some people may split off from wherever the majority goes, we need to give them the opportunity to participate in FRC
thoughts??^^
i think i possible approach that would mend relationships would be to hold a meeting among the skunk family on tuesday with gudor and wilson at the school so their voices are heard and being listened to and then on thursday we ask that the meeting be cancelled and then the skunk family meet in the RBC as we would have now heard from our coaches and all and then on thursday we can make a decision within in the skunk family
push off the meeting at the school?
According to teachers and students, we are not being fair to the group that would want a new team if we push this off
I can arrange a meeting later this week
So school has opportunity to start new team
If the school wants a non-4H team we need to decide if we go 4H tomorrow
<@U1FAR4AJU> did you say you can get access to the RBC on any night this week?
I know for a fact that not everyone on the team (students) knows what's going on
But a big thing that came out of the meeting was that the school will have a robotics team no matter what. They really want that team to be us. Idk how everyone feels about giving them a chance tomorrow 
More or less
that's the scoop?
or we have both and everyone eventually gets heard
So we either have one meeting (outside or in) or we have two. The one meeting option we exclude people because of the school and the timing outside.
We realize the entire skunk family will not be able to attend a meeting at school (like coach) but we could possibly set up a video conference and a way of inputting opinions through a anonymous source. Idk what you all think about keeping the meeting at school and involving parents, so a decision has not been made 
One of his big concerns was that he and ms wilson, our current coaches, are being kept out of the loop and not involved in important decisions. They believe that having a meeting offsite will drive a wedge in our team by excluding the teacher perspective. 
Rip sent that prematurely
He just said yesterday that the vote is occurring.
Ok so I don't feel a strong need to go so unless someone requests that I go I probably won't 
It's not actually included on the agenda, so I'm clarifying with Mr. Smith over email about that
Agenda:

Officer elections

selecting a financial review committee for last years books.
Is that it?
i.e. where the money is going to go
The agenda is voting on whether the spaghetti dinner will be put on booster club books or PTSA books
What is the agenda? I'm debating on going or staying home and doing home work 
Who alls going to the booster club meeting?
At 6 o'clock
12015 Roseberg Ave S, Seattle, WA 98168
Also for reference:
if anyone needs a ride to the booster club meeting I can oblige
<!channel> right now there's an informal meeting in the conference room  on the first floor for general discussion and planning tomorrow's meeting. Feel free to attend.
must be something with the slack web app
all good
my bad
apparently slack didn't load that in
I can see it too
Its all there, just really high up
May just be the internet connection.
I can see all of it
I can't see any of the conversation that happened over the weekend, the ones where we were talking about the meeting being on such short notice
We're on the slack free plan so I can't view deleted messages
Which messages?
did someone delete all the messages over the weekend?
<!channel>
^ that seems important
<@U1F1ETJM7> pinned a message to this channel.
I will let people know at lunch if the other meeting can be moved. Otherwise, those going to the RBC will need to email Gudor and Wilson saying they can't make the school-sanctioned meeting
You can't argue that meetings are being scheduled at times you can't make, and at times you 100% can make
The reason for another meeting held at this time is so that everybody can be on the same page about decisions being made. You were worried about decisions being made at the meeting you could not attend, so we're trying to find solutions to that problem. We're not trying to exclude anybody or disrespect authority; we're trying to do the exact opposite.
There are three other free days in a week and you chose this one. You shouldnt be messing with the routine of everyone else because you made a mistake.
You cant, no. But your coaches and any other students who attend can, and there will be current students in attendance.
We can't educate new students if no one is there
Holding the meeting earlier will allow students to attend both meetings
here's the thing: most of the mentors and the students are aware of another meeting scheduled on top of that that is more important to the future of the team.
The robotics practice will be held at school. The new students and any others will be there. The interim coaches and others will be there and have a plan to teach the students and get them ready for build season as it comes.
Oh wait I understand
Until 6?
Ok because the RBC is booked until 6
^ right now we have no way of telling the freshmen either not to show up or to come to our meeting. They won't let us make an announcement and they won't let us cancel the meeting. We have every intention of holding the meeting we discussed
So that the freshmen aren't left completely behind
We are just looking at changing the time of the at-school meeting
We are still meeting at the same time
let’s meet up and send out something during lunch?
Are we still meeting? Idk I just saw th slack messages 
Yay!!!!!!
thank you!!!
Hey so I just got the RBC over at the museum reserved for 6pm....
I mean it's not my decision
Could I get it to 4-5 then? At least try?
And I don't think that gudor/wilson (not that its their choice, they might not be allowed to say yes) would sign on
we won't be able to move off campus quick enough to a new site, unless we do secure a spot at the MoF
Just got a suggestion to move at school meeting to 5-6 so that we can deal with freshmen. How do people feel about this?
We're getting screwed right now. By October we'll either have access to the shop or not.
This is happening now, and there's no way that a flyer article can truly represent the situation that has occurred. Regardless of how good of a writer he is, he is going to be formal, and again its too far in the future to do any good
That's faaaaar too long
Soon team leads, Tipton, and hopefully a mentor or two will speak to Timothy who is writing an article in October
I don't know if now is the right time, but soon for sure.
One other thing we should think about is when we should start talking to the rest of the school about this. Thomas Kirby and I are talking right now and we believe that we would get a _huge_ amount of support from the student body if we start talking truthfully about everything that has happened and how we have been wronged. I know things are still in flux and being decided, but I think that if everybody understood the situation as well as we did, suddenly Tipton has 400 students against her, not 40.
doesn't look like the email Zuzanna sent out went to a mentor group as well
That sounds like a good idea
Okay. We can make sure that all of the students are aware, but it's up to us as well to make sure that the mentors that were not in the meeting are aware as well. Most of them should be on the email list, but if you have personal contacts, it may be a good idea to reach out.
^^^exactly
Technically a different meeting will be held at the school, but students who will attend that meeting will not have a say in the direction of the team
I mean, I guess they can show up for the entire time if they want to, but we need to make it clear to students that the meeting will *_not_* be held at the school tomorrow.
Yeah but it wasn't just students deciding it.
While not many were at the meeting, it was certainly a student suggestion to hold this meeting at this time
I think this is a really important distinction about how we may be treated moving forward.
It wasn't our decision, it was the _teams_ decision, but we're not recognized as our own entity anymore I guess
That's really frustrating.
He will not cancel. He says it is not up to the students to cancel, and he is sorry for giving us that impression
How much does gudor know? I'm in his class rn but I don't know what to talk about besides saying "cancel the meeting"
Thanks for sending me the email guys, and thanks <@U1F0QEL0Z> for the explanation!
Okay Gudor and Wilson will not cancel the meeting. Those of you who do not wish to help decide the future of the team may meet at the school. However, everyone who will come to the off campus meeting to hear what is going on, voice their opinions, and make a decision, MUST email <mailto:michael.gudor@highlineschools.org|michael.gudor@highlineschools.org> and <mailto:karen.wilson@highlineschools.org|karen.wilson@highlineschools.org> saying you will not be attending.
Tipton mentioned the ASB intercom as a way of notifying freshmen, but she does not agree that the meeting is cancelled, which I am working on rn
Whoops
Done
I can
Can someone forward the email to Kenny?
It was cancelled because for one we don't want tipton to be apart of it so we can inform the team as a whole of the options we can take, re-hashing what went on Sunday, and because Steele isn't allowed on campus. I believe those were the two main reasons why.
I didn't get the email either so I don't have a sense of why the meeting was cancelled
When I was talking about "where this goes tomorrow", I was referring to whatever you were going to do today to announce it to the freshmen Izzie -- whether it be with announcing it on the intercom or something else
Nobody responded to my statement here and I decided not to make the announcement because I was afraid of making a false announcement
<@U1F06GSNQ> Am I correct in assuming that you said nvm after checking with someone else if you could release that message on the PSA?
Why never mind?
Nvm, we're going to have to see where this goes tomorrow
I can announce it on the PSA to get the message to some of the new students
Ok 
It's a work in progress
Multiple times
Chances are that will be released via intercom
I am speaking with Gudor and Wilson about letting them know it has been cancelled
I think we should let them figure it out
I am handling that
that seems a bit too crazy
Cause we encouged them to go
Should we send out something to the freshmen or new sophomores that wanted to attend the Tuesday meeting too
Um
Your welcome
Thanks Brandon!

Thanks 
thanks anna

Okay thanks
I can send it to brandon
it must be the mail application that you use. but what’s your email brandon
I can forward it to evryone who was on FTC but i need david to forward it to me
To be fair <@U27TQ5U7K>, the formatting looks fine on my mom's outlook account
Okay can someone forward the email to <@U5M1Q2ZJT> and <@U7388S8CF> 
I haven't gotten anything either 
Could someone with her email forward it to her?
Formatting has been fixed!
She didn’t get it because the only email lists it was sent to was ones that Mr. Smith put together by class and the new students are on FRC Team and FRC Students etc. he doesn’t move them all. 
Have you signed up for team emails yet?
Was is it supposed to be the notes from today or something?
hmm that’s weird
I didn't get anything??
^^^^
Why is it an e e Cummings poem
and it still does
sorry about that, i have no idea what happened as it looked perfectly fine
Shhh

Thank you, to be clear I just trying to be helpful.
Ok it's gone
Please don't share that recording and please delete it as Washington has two-party consent laws for recordings. We just don't want to create any legal issues. Here's a link that explains the law: <http://www.dmlp.org/legal-guide/washington/washington-recording-law>
Hey the meeting just ended for all who weren't able to come, I recorded the whole thing I will be uploading that when I get home.
<!channel> last chance to fill out the survey, link is in the message I sent originally or in the channel pins. 
^ make them feel wanted
Just a quick thing...I want to encourage everyone to be thankful of our mentors, at the meeting today, and just in general. They do a lot for the team, and a lot of that work is behind the scenes, so please thankful and encouraging towards them as they are donating hundreds and even thousands of volunteer hours to help us learn and succeed.
I'll be there 
Sadly I can't, my dad will be there tho
<@U1F6AR1NF> are you going?
I also know <@U1F1ETJM7> will be going
And <@U73DQN95H> 
I'll be there
I am
And <@U1F05PEAY> 
And <@U1HABM1NE> 
In the snapchat I think <@U1F0EN0A2> just said he was
I am
<@U1F0BGMLN> and I are
Who all is going to the meeting today?
We have qualitative feedback, but we are summarizing that and not posting it because some people include identifying phrases
That's good, I would like more input than that, like to actually know who the people are. I mean right now the graphs are just "theoretical person or bowlin?"
Not for at least another week
Ok
So are we eventually going to get a list of potential coaches? Like their names? Or are we just going to ask for something general, like "FIRST-associated person" and then Tipton gives us whatever she wants
Yeah....
Purple is "Eithrr"
Outside hire with FIRST experience
What does the pink stand for?
Purple, Light Blue, and Pink on main coach graph were written in
Exactly
Someone typed that into other
There was an "anyone but Bowlin" selection? Oh shit I didn't see that

I can give out pie charts rn, just give me a sec
<!channel> ^
^ what do other people think
That's a good idea too
Why not just do it at the Tuesday meeting, I mean that’s when everyone’s going to be in the same room at the same time 
Lol yeah, is it still too early to know the results of the survey?
Whatever works for everyone
 ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Last time it was in Joshi's room before school. Time before that was in cad lab.
When and where
Yeah, but do we want a post-meeting discussion about what happened too like last time or just the notes?
I can take notes at the meeting if that’s what you mean 
well so far it seems like the majority of kids can't go, so we need some kind of reliable source to learn what happened at the meeting
What do you mean?
I can't go either, but we should probably have an in person meeting to discuss what happened when a few students went to talk to the mentors
I can't go but it's okay
only a pre-calc kid this math is way over my head
Memed?
well tucker is right its an expression, but you know
:purple_heart::blue_heart::heart::gift_heart::yellow_heart::revolving_hearts::two_hearts::heavy_heart_exclamation_mark_ornament::heartbeat::heartpulse::sparkling_heart::cupid:
it's an expression tho
? no its definitely just root 7
x is every number
I mean
Thank you Nick
isnt that imaginary?
rofl my guy
Or wanna be anonymous 
Or post in Google form if you can't come
Take a deep breath ppl lets not argue this. Bottom line: there's a meeting Sunday planned without knowledge of all the team that we cannot really change. Show up if you can, ask someone to say what you need to say if you can't. Next time, we can trust that you'll all have more advance but work with it for now kk?
About not being hostile? I agree that sometimes it seems like certain opinions aren't welcome among certain groups of students, but it sorta seemed like u were saying that in response to Tucker
Jesus
can someone help with my math homework. (x^2)+7, x=??
There's plenty of other points that I made that you can focus on as well

It seemed like he was just stating fact...
We are all hostile at times and this is through text so you might interpret it differently than I do
I didn't see Tucker being hostile....
Why is there always so much hostility. No wonder we can't function, we can't trust each other. When all we do is bitch at each other and complain and think that we're better than each other we don't ever get anything done. I know I don't feel comfortable giving any of my opinions because I know there's two sides and no matter what I say I'm gonna piss off one side and I don't really want to do that. We need to be unified with students and mentors but we are divided and we're too busy nacking at each other and getting mad and angry and frustrated at each other we can't come together it's just not going to happen. I think there should've been more communication and I understand that it's short notice but it would've been nice unrealistically. I asked the question because I didn't understand and I don't know if you're commenting on what I had to say tucker but I don't know how to respond to you without pissing off one side of the team or the other because are obviously split on what we want and where we want to go with the team. It does seem a little back roomy for us to meet like this but I do understand the short notice. I wish I could speak freely and not feel judgment and not feel like what I have to say is going to put me in a bad position with some of the team and mentors because my opinion isn't the same as yours Tucker, but I feel like the hostility that you have towards anybody that doesn't exactly aline with your opinion is punished one way or another. We all need to feel comfortable and safe talking to each other freely and openly if you don't like something we should be able to say and not fear Judgment in hate from each other. That's our proper team and should function in my eyes. We are so broken and so split that I don't see how we can all be happy with the outcome of anything really. So if anyone has any ideas so we can all be happy I'd love to hear it even if you think it's going to go against the common opinion. I just want to hear everyone's ideas I won't judge you, but I can't promise about anybody else. message me privately if you want but I'd prefer to be in here so everyone can see everyone else's opinions so that we start to work towards a safer friendlier team for everyone 
That's the time crunch
And I'm not saying its bad to give opinions, but us students thinking we can make the entire thing happen is a complete farse. 
No coach + no mentors = not meeting requirements
And we can't register our team if we don't meet the requirements for a FIRST team as well
Oh okay
Closes jeez
Closed
Then first pref closed
We only have until Thirsday
^ exactly
I thought it was preference based so we didnt have to worry about being late
Also, event sign ups opened up yesterday. Was anybody aware of that? It's not a big problem because its a different system than it was last year, but we're already starting to miss dates
We just need a main goal for.the team
Those things too
We need to be able to explain the plan to them for the year
There is a booster club meeting AND a meeting with Tipton on Monday
We have new kids coming on
On*
Why not just talk in Tuesday with everyone? Am I missing the urgency that it has to be Sunday? 
Ok Eli scheduled what he could in the timeframe we have
Its not important what is important is the motivational speech hidden within that I wrote when I was half asleep
Just statements 
I just feel like one way communication, from either side, isn't especially helpful because it doesn't allow for conversations
Could you clarify pronouns please and the context if it sent late?
Fuck that sent late
No he's not and he is right. This is our team now. We need to work together and that's what this group chat is for. This year is our opportunity to rise up and come back from before and we all want that. Focus on the long run here guys
*agreement with Eli
Because for once we want to make choices? So we talk to each other and have secret meetings like they do?
No, it's supposed to be a discussion
It is a meeting for us to share our opinions
I don’t think that saying that is disrespectful. 
The meeting isn’t about us. It’s about their opinions. If you do in fact share what is said with us then why would they need us all to be there. 
It's not a meeting for the students to voice their opinion though. It's for the mentors to tell us what they think (ok I miss read)
That is incredibly disrespectful to the mentors
I think the mentors will listen to the kids that are there but many students won't be able to make it because of the short notice and their opinions won't be heard
You said they chose the time and it’s their meeting, so why would they change it because not all the students can go. They want to share their opinions so as long as at least one student is there, I get the feeling that is good enough for them. 
The time was not set quickly to exclude people
It was planned without most of the teams input and sprung on us without proper time to make arangements
It feels like a back room meeting like the parent meetings used to be.
I'm not trying to be passive agressive, sorry if it's coming off that way, I'm just trying to understand what people mean
Omg this is why our team is broken dude. 
Are you saying you don't think our opinions would be heard?
I just don’t want to argue about something that isn’t really in our control. Eli said that mentors decided the time so there’s no use in us as students arguing about it. I was upset and reacted out of impulse and that wasn’t necessary. 
Why are we all hostile toward each other shit dude. Everyone just needs to chill out. Difference in opinion is ok. Not understand that is what got us in this mess in the first place
Okay. 
It’s gonna be word for word
Oh my god
Second hand information again. Let’s be honest, they aren’t going to change the date or time so there’s no use arguing over it. It sucks and it isn’t fair and it’s poorly planned but we can move on. 
I’ve just asked a few mentors for their take. I’ll add their comments into this chat if that’s better for everyone
Yea it’s not Eli’s fault he was simply trying to organize a meeting. I can’t make it this Sunday though
no make another chat because they can see the previous conversations
Nah just let them voice their opinion in a different chanel
Because I get it; the meeting deadline is really short. I'm trying my best to compile what everyone needs
Temporary access
After they give their take
No
We could remove mentors later 
And I did my best to incorporate options for people that couldn't make it
No
<@U1F1NQKAN> Should I add mentors to this chat? They can discuss it directly if you'd like
*listed
Tucker just listened options for it not to be 2nd hand info
Is it the finale say? No.
2nd hand information like always though
Sometimes we miss meetings
I know I'm not going to be there because of my mom, I'm fine with that because I know I can get the info later. 
I appreciate Eli organizing the meeting. No it is not his fault but such a short notice is a bit hard especially if it is on a weekend. 
But we don't have time. We have been wanting to know what is going on, and sooner is better than later
Maybe we all could have organized something further back. It’s not Eli’s fault
Hence, later on. Not in two days. Maybe in a week. 
<@U1F1ETJM7> pinned a message to this channel.
Or just told us it was in progress
Not much more time to organize
Coach was fired on Monday
And he should have organized something farther in advance. 
From what I heard he literally organized this within the last day or two
Again would've been nice to know this was in progressive 
I cannot make it Sunday. It is not fair, as ailis mentioned, to hold a meeting as important as this on such a short notice.
We are on a time crunch, just to get some insight into what they think and its the worst thing ever? If eli already agreed on a date I think we should stick to it. It's not impossible to record the conversation and for people to be on speaker calls... I think It's good that he organized it because we haven't even talked to them. Better now than never. Nothings going to happen in one night.
Yeah I would've loved more of a heads up on that... 
*Think
I do thing we are running out of time on things like signing up for events, things that require us to know where we stand as a team
Next weekend would probably be better
Two days notice for a meeting that is this important is completely unfair and not okay. I’m glad that this is the date and time that works for you and the key mentors that you’re speaking of but as a result you are alienating the students that have busier schedules or already have plans. What about people going to church on Sunday? People who are out of town like Erin. Just like you’re saying this isn’t just all about the students, it isn’t all about the mentors. Planning this meeting is a step in the right direction for full open communication but there has to be more notice. 
<!channel> 
Hey guys. After having conversations with a few mentors yesterday, I personally have come to the conclusion that before we finalize our plans for the team, we need to make sure that the voices of our mentors are heard. I don't say this lightly, but I believe that if we continue to try to make decisions on our own, the decisions we make will be incomplete. We thought that by making these decisions on our own, we would be able to steer away from parent and mentor bias. However, how can we make decisions about the team without the team involved? From the conversations I've had, I've come to understand that some of the mentors feel unwanted; specifically about their opinions. They don't feel welcome back after coach was fired from his position, and after Thomas was removed from his role as volunteer. By excluding mentors from the decisions we're making as a "team," we're effectively telling the mentors that we no longer value their input. If we don't value their input, we don't function as a team. We lose the skunk family. To be clear: I don't think that any of us intentionally did anything wrong. I feel that in the midst of it all, we haven't considered all of the different points of view that we should have. 

I don't believe the situation is lost however. I know that personally I love the mentors, and they've had an incredibly profound impact on my life that I couldn't even come close to describing. It hurt like Mr. Bowlin described at the parent meeting, and it came as a shock to hear that some of them feel like we don't value their input, and that they no longer feel like we have the same goals in mind. I think it's past time that we start sharing and engaging in discussion with the mentors that we've worked with and trusted for multiple years at this point. The mentors have made it clear that they're interested in our ideas as much as they want us to hear theirs; it needs to be a two way street where we feel comfortable discussing everything robotics related. I've been helping to setup a meeting this weekend at Trevor Gardner's house, 9/24 on Sunday at 1PM address 611 SW 201st St. Normandy Park, WA 98166. Please try to organize carpools, for parking is limited. Also, if enough people show up, please be ready to move outside and hold the discussion there, where we would have to stand if you don't bring your own seating. If it really is too many people, we may move to Marvista Park where there is a big enough gazebo to host us. The parties invited to participate in discussion about the team are the students, the mentors, and the parents. Everybody should have a say in the decisions that are being made for the team. It is critical that as many people come to the meeting as possible, but if you can't make it we will take detailed notes on what happened so that everyone can stay on the same page. If you have any questions, please feel free to ask them here or in person and I'll answer to the best of my ability.

Oh end of school day

Ok I apologize, I was under the impression it was due at the end of the day otherwise I would have gotten it sooner
It’s not fair to leave anyone out. So we are trying to get the last 8
We are missing 8 responses. The cutoff was actually at 2 pm. We just want more accurate results
Yes. 
So if we just did it will it be added

Cool, when do we get to see the results?
Right now. 
Yeah. When is the cutoff for the survey?
