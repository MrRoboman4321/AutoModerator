i think its pretty obvious when a robot doesnt have a radio
we put a radio on 2016 and it drove for a while
and lol 2017 isn't plugged into the radio 
lol 2016 doesn't have a radio 
But I don’t think it’s software

Also 2016 bot is broken
okay I didn't do that

just wiped all the code from the roborio
what did it break? sorry I didn't mention it, I didn't know info night was tonight
woohoo
Very broken

did that break things? <@U1FAR4AJU>

<!channel> hey so Naba wants to leave
okay
as it defines the order that they're meant to be called it
because `Command.run()` is the only thing that should call them
so that they don't get called out of order by things that aren't `Command.run()`
okay, so protected so that they don't get called out of order by Command.run()?
so protected is the next best thing
ideally they would be private because they should only be called by `Command.run()`, but subclasses can't override private methods because they don't know they exist
but out of order != can be called
yes
<https://stackoverflow.com/questions/215497/in-java-difference-between-default-public-protected-and-private> is what I found, it looks like they can be called out of the subclass of command?
making them protected prevents them from being called out-of-order outside of subclasses of `Command`
those methods are parts of a strategy that are supposed to be called in a specific order, which is defined in `Command.run()`
no friends in java?? how lonely
commands use the strategy pattern <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy_pattern>
no friends in java
;)
because friends can only access your privates with protection
<@U1F0LEQ3W> Why protected init, exec, interrupt and end?
Gyro is functional. We will need a teacher (admin) to log onto the computers and install the navx mxp library, then move a file over, but it actually was pretty easy beyond that to get setup

I actually have to go for dinner. Read over <https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/concepts/class.html> (found pretty quick, but quality looks okay) and it should widen the realm of possibility a little bit on what classes can be

<@U1F1ETJM7> I can finish the Codeavademy Java lesson by tonight, but I don't understand some topics very well. Should I skip over them and go to the next one, or spend more time figuring it out? I can write some questions down to go over tomorrow.

Eh, you probably won't be able to fix the fact that you don't have jdk installed. There are java compilers online (<https://www.jdoodle.com/online-java-compiler> as an example) that you can probably navigate to use

If you guys go from programming to cheese and some fairly impressive puns during pre-season, what's going to happen during build season?
when we're setting people up with jdk I'll start checking 32 vs 64 bit. I'm guessing the difference (from a visual perspective only) would be installing in Program Files vs. x86?
Ah ok
I think the main issue was jdk 1.8 vs 1.9 vs jre vs exe
I’ll step back out and you may resume

<@U1F0LEQ3W> That's what it looks like.
the jdk 1.8.exe is the *installer* for jdk, so you'll need to get Ms Wilson or MC to enter credentials to install it.
JDK 1.8 is in a folder marked "FRC-SOFTWARE 2017"

I'm not sure what's up with the "bin" and "lib" but from that I don't think you have jdk 1.8 installed
lib
bin
jre1.8.0_131
There is:
Can you navigate to "C:\Program Files\Java" and list what's in there?
I'm not sure if I can give you a clear answer on that. I opened the "jdk-9_windows-x64_bin.exe", but all it did was ask me for admin credentials.
Are you sure the jdk is installed or is it just the installer
<@U7PBL4GTV> Yes, and we're struggling
<@U7PBR1J4B> Are you trying to set the jdk location to some folder
Ok
Ok, then we'll do it here
I can for sure help you tomorrow at some point but going to MC again probably won't help, unless you're missing software.
I don't count on McLaughlin to fix these kind of things; he's great at installing things but I wouldn't trust him to set up my dev environment fully

Here, how about we just fix this when we're at school? I can go to MC Glock, and see if he can fix this. If push comes to shove, I'll do it on ms word and get it reviewed by you guys.

<@U7PBR1J4B>
Can you post a screenshot of your "jkd1.8.0_&lt;something&gt;" directory, and confirm that the Java SDK is pointed to that?

it should have installed to C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_(whatever version) by default
I'll change the location, and see if it works
also <@U1F0W3FFC> we're using java 8
it should be in program files i think

what's in that folder?
the jdk folder is in your downloads?

Yup
?
is the folder unzipped

where is ur jdk located, just curious

Thats what it says
The selected directory is not a valid home for JDK
my jdk is @ C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-9
Keeps saying SDK doesn’t exist 
I'll try it a again and see
Yeah I’m having the same thing 
whatd it say?

hmm
I tried that one
called something like jdk-1.8 or something
nah it should be the folder with the jre

I'm literally doing classes on Java right now

just googled it, turns out java doesn't have classes or switch case 
<@U1F0W3FFC> you're in luck
At least they if/else
is there even switch case in java , seems like something only a high iq language would have 
you can join them
I think they may be starting the robotic arm project
yeah.....
Is it too late to join SciOli?
we switch/case on this team only.....
oh .... nobody told him??
<@U1F0QEL0Z> Just if/else(if) the hell outta that
then it crashes the fms!!!!!!!
someone's preseason project should be putting speakers on the robot with the turret voice tbh 
but what if there isn't a function on the other side that takes strings???????
now you're thinking with portals
if the fms sends a string with scores, why don't we just edit that string, make our score higher, and send it back????:thinking_face::thinking_face::thinking_face::thinking_face::thinking_face::thinking_face:

Oh, ok. The people in the airships needed that for free gears <@U1F0LEQ3W>
so like, if they wanted to add a gate as part of the field that was software controlled, this would be the way to check on its state
make the robot drive at 200% throttle if the opposing alliances score is higher :triumph::triumph:

<@U7PBR1J4B> there are already mechanisms for that, I think this is specifically for the state of the game rather than the state of the robot or the field
string separated by robot emojis :robot_face: 
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
If I'm getting this right, are there gonna be status updates from the robot to the drive team?
```&gt;json```
"power_up_dead_bot"
"Game Specific data string" is hella sketchy tho
depending on implementation
hey that's actually not bad
"Starting this year, WPILib, in all 3 languages, will have APIs to access a Game Specific data string which will contain information sent from the Field Management System to the Robot (via the Driver Station). There will also be a new text box in the Driver Station which will allow teams to simulate this functionality when testing at home. The implementation has been kept as generic as possible to allow for maximum flexibility as we use this new feature in future years."

<@U1F0QEL0Z> yes but that's already a thing, just give other robots hard enough love taps

that disables all the other teams robots

<@U1F0LEQ3W> I'm not sure where I should write out the code for the calculator project.
<@U7PBR1J4B> sorry, could you clarify the question?
I'm not even going to pretend I comprehend that rn 
<@U5MHBBXD0> I'll assume that functional means awake &amp; alert. Dude, I owe it all to R&amp;B and constant fluctuations on the position of my spine.

The last message was to <@U1F0LEQ3W>.
Yeah sorry.
pls
*bit coin*
U mean calculator?
think I'm missing something here
wait, wallet?
Hey programming, where do I create the wallet? I'm not sure what program was installed on my computer.
Heh it's all good
Interesting. I’ll take a peak when I’m next in. I dot. Want to distract the team with my crazy experiments 
Theyve locked us out of the first since forever, and the second as of this year
Unfortunately
That'd work if we could edit our environment var OR our local environment var
Basically you unpack it on system you have rights to and then push the JDK to a usb drive then copy it over. Yes it makes some things easier if you install the default way but there is nothing requiring it
Yes because Java doesn’t care where it is installed. It is a Windows convention that it get installed there. You just point your environment variable and IDE to wherever you installed it.
<@U7RLA5T62> can you do jdk w/o admin even if we don't have w access to /Programfiles/?
And you can ask one of the teachers for jdk
When you launch intellij it prompts for a password and i just used mine, worked fine
If anyone is curious, happy to walk you through all the steps when we have free time
JDK still requires admin for sanity.  It is possible to install JDK without admin rights but it requires some hoops to jump through
Also by the way for those in the future that were worried about needing admin rights, you can install IntelliJ without Admin rights.  <https://intellij-support.jetbrains.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/206899909-Is-it-possible-to-install-on-windows-as-standard-user>
Oh ok
Most likely won't *need* them.  The community edition provides 95% of what you would need.  There were some Thursday that didn't have the community edition but had the full edition and only had the 30 day trial.  I reached out to JetBrains and they offered us complimentary licenses if we wanted them to their entire product suite.  Not mandated but available if we want the full edition instead of community.
Why do we need licenses, like my intellij seems to work fine
Ok as the requestor, I am the one who needs to hand out IntelliJ licenses.  If you need/want a license, shoot me a note and I'll send you the link.
Cool.
Generally the community keys are twelve months but a piece of cake to renew. JetBrains likes to do this stuff.
Do those keys have an expiry?
For the ones that got trial that probably makes sense, yeah.
Should be able to just drop keys in and go
But I know there were a few that we think installed trial instead of community 
If its a redownload, we will need admin on the computers again which is a hassle, and I would be tentative unless there are significant advantages to ultimate &gt; community
Will we need to redownload the ultimate edition, or can we do a straight upgrade once it's downloaded?
Hey everyone. JetBrains approved free full licenses for IntelliJ for the team. I have 20. When I’m back home this evening, I will get the information out. I’ll need someone to be the keeper/distributor of the keys. 
<!channel> 
Hey all. With the limited amount of time left in pre-season, we gotta start setting some due dates to make sure that we can move forward as a team. By tuesday, I want everyone to have completed the Java Codecademy course. It's pretty short, and I know most of you have already done a good portion or a majority of it, so it shouldn't be too much work. If you get stuck, you can direct message Mr Vader, Thomas DeSilva or I with questions. After you finish the codecademy, the next step is to show off you object-oriented skills by making a Calculator class that will do math based on user input. If you guys get there, I'll post more specifics on what that should look like. Thanks and see you all at Girls Gen.
<@U7RLA5T62> has joined the group
We’ve been here for an hour and a half lmao
Ye Bella David and i
Oh rip
Now, in the plc
no
When is it
Are you presenting
wow
No
anyone going to the wpi presentation?
Yes
hek no
anyone in comp sci club? :evan_irl: 
Also, my apologies, earlier I said David Hadley was elected to the steering committee. It was instead Evan Frishholz
Questions/random talk can come here or through private messages
Beyond that, just keep working away at Codecademy. The basic steps for you to follow right now are finish the Java Codecademy course, then go through the Git "Hello World" tutorial. After that, we'll set you up with some more challening projects.
Between now and Thursday, keep trying to get to McLaughlin and get your development environments installed. We want to get this done as soon as possible so as many of you can get working on robot code before too long, which is a big step forward.
<!channel> Everybody should be in here now, please tell me ASAP if you see anybody that's missing. Slack is our main mode of communication, you're expected to be able to be contacted on it regularly. It's not as big of a deal pre-season, but during build season it can be critical to be able to get a hold of somebody at a moments notice. I forgot to mention this at the meeting tonight, but you should get slack on your phones as well and setup notifications, so that your presence here isn't solely linked to you being on your laptop.

I don't fully understand everything about what their talking about but this seems pretty devestating
<https://www.krackattacks.com/>
they've got their priorities straight on which things are more vulnerable than others
For example, HTTPS was previously bypassed in non-browser software, in Apple's iOS and OS X, in Android apps, in Android apps again, in banking apps, and *even in VPN apps*.

<https://stackoverflow.com/a/33066581/5217216> this is probably a good thing for people to read as java works the same way
yeah
I think that's the trick here
well, in this case the value that you're assigning is a reference
I had been taught that python was 100% pass by value
I know but I didn't think python didn't do any pass by reference
remember that with arrays, the variable stores a pointer to the first index, so you are indeed dealing with a reference
to be fairer in a non-copypasta kind of way, you'd get the same behavior if you did that in C/C++
*sigh*
To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Python. The language is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of it will go over a typical programmer's head. 
I'm trying to debug code and I have an array that's changing when I never change the value of it anywhere, so I think its gotta be something to do with this
```
abc = [1, 2, 3]
xyz = abc
abc[0] = 0
&gt;&gt;&gt;abc
[0, 2, 3]
&gt;&gt;&gt;xyz
[0, 2, 3]
xyz[0] = 1
&gt;&gt;&gt;abc
[1, 2, 3]
&gt;&gt;&gt;xyz
[1, 2, 3]
```
but arrays
```
a = 5
b = a
a = 2
&gt;&gt;&gt;b
5
```
most of the times when you set one variable equal to another, you're setting a copy
python is a terrifying language
did you delete a message nathan or is slack being buggy

I'll hold on making the vision repo public until I get Erik's approval
there's no reason to keep it private, share our mistakes so other's won't make them
oh well
which doesn't make sense

It means that we can reuse this code for 201
Do people really need to know that we had 3 master branches?
Wait I thought of a reason to keep it private
visionrecognition too?
Public.

If they were smart they would have found a way to not be freshmen
are there any smart fresh people?
lets get them to learn labview
What
uhh
oops
leader of fresh people bella bella bella mike
Have them learn 2017 or slippery which eases them into build seeaosn 
ok so who is gonna be the fresh prince of fresh people
i agree with tucker
We'll let them teach themselves to program while we make the chairmans video
I think your idea works
?
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nCqRmx3Dnw>
wait so have we figured out what we're doing with the freshpeople?
Let's all join satellite
let's all become logistic leads
I feel personally targeted 
Let's just all go to chairmans
Ha jokes on you me and Nathan are switching places
Ree get out design normie

Let's round it to a yes
Shame it's such a close call

We should make a 4H computer science team
lmao who would ever want to learn how to program
Make it robotics programming club
Should we join or nahhhh

There are 6 people here, only 2 of us that aren't leading the meeting know code, and it's just incredibly awkward and not so hot
Rip I was gonna go what’s going on
dear lord the comp sci club that is being started at our school is no bueno
Official list of what you'll be getting if you go down to MC
Software
IntelliJ - Java IDE that will allow us to write code
FRC IntelliJ plugin - Software written for IntelliJ to provide more robust tools specifically for development with Java in an FRC context
JDK 1.8 - Java Development Kit, requried to compile any kind of java program.
FRC Update Suite - Various software and backend libraries to allow us to run other required software (Driverstation, SmartDashboard, etc)
CTRLib - A library that we will need downloaded and put into the WPILib user folder (downloaded and installed through the FRC Update Suite)
Git - Version control software that allows for the team to manage multi person development of the code base.
I didn't get an email but Joshi might be confirming directly.
Alright it's been two minutes are we good
nice
Once he sends the email
Literally in about 2 minutes
so whens the earliest we can get stuff on our computers
oh
He didn't understand he needed to confirm, so he's sending an email to mclaughlin right now
I'll check
did the program list get approved by joshi/mclaughlin
Sure, that's one idea
but if they have their own project they're working on for slippery/2017 they can pick up some skills without worrying about anyone undoing
none of the freshmen are going to learn anything if we just keep re-writing their code
right, maybe it might be better if that's what they do year round 
It's totally doable preseason
We won't have things for them to do
I'm just concerned about build season
they get experience with a legit robot and we dont have to worry about stepping on them
sounds kinda bad but maybe we should just let the freshpeople work on a previous years robot
*dab*

1983 and 7005

no problem.
And WPILib is part of the FRC Update Suite
kind of busy right now though
it's not
Going through and listing software to install, step 5 is not needed for mclaughlin right?

I have the opportunity to put together a list right now
<@U1F0LEQ3W> Where is the Java setup guide?
Joshi*
Okay, then if nothing changes before tomorrow I'll present the list to JOshi
<@U1F1ETJM7> we need to get that list approved as soon as we can do that we make sure we can get everything downloaded before approval becomes a lot more complicated 
I think the list is the stuff on the java setup guide, the FRC update suite, and git, but I might be forgetting something
I've talked to him about it, just need the list
Joshi is going to sign off on the list
so joshi is the one signing off on the list or is that someone else
Mr Vader was going to test Thomas's list before I confirmed with joshi and got it to McLaughlin
so what's the situation with the program list for mclaughlin?
^ yee
That module can then be actually built for programmers to play with 
:ok_hand:
Payton can incorporate it into his new drive base design for the mock build season
wowowowowowowow
Lol
WOAHAHAAHHA
(shes right next to me rn)
but it will be in cad
I just talked to Izzie about preseason projects and suggested it
we aren't going to build a robot
the | is on the right side, the -- is on the left
design team is going through a whole mock build season, If you guys want to talk with us while we are doing that we can integrate sensors and things like that into the design
and lots of math
right; they had one | and one --
and you need to have a way of dealing with rotation, so you either need two or to not care about rotation and put it dead center
well, and a place to mount it to
on a suspension
We shouldn't need an extra motor port; just an axle with an encoder
yeah
Then it's just incorporated during build season as an "x by y by z" volume slot on the drivebase
Naively it should be a preseason design project
I mean
we've talked about doing that but never had the space/time
they're on a suspension so they should stay engaged all the time
they have 2 sets of omnis that are just for encoding

There definitely will be a new survey
within the students there was some confusion about what the survey that generated the pie chart seen above was for (interim coach vs. permanent coach) so there may be a reassess.
None of those four will be as fair as I know.
<@U1F0LEEE9> <@U1F0LEQ3W> <@U2KD3E39A> The general consensus within the team at this points seems to be to stay with the school. Today we found out that Wilson, Gudor, Joshi, and Ms. Jones will be "interim" coaches. They will switch off, and meetings (starting next week) will run from 6-8 (they don't want to work incredibly long days). Tipton has said that within 30 days from now she'd like for us to have a permanent coach.
It's fine
It merely needs convincing
Now that you've kicked it

just asked joshi, he'll do it for us
r i p
just talked to mclaughlin, he says we needs a teacher to write up a list of all the programs we need
by the way: the school laptops now have locked access to the environment variable panel, so we cannot add even to our user path without administrator intervention.
but yeah, feel free to ask if you're not sure if something I'm saying just seems objective to me because of my experiences or if I have actual evidence
which is what's making a lot of this hard and why you guys feel left out of the loop, because it's really hard to draw that line right now
and in general my goal is to be honest at all times and as open as possible, but there are occasionally things that mentors aren't supposed to talk to students about because it wouldn't be professional
I agree
I'm not saying that opinions shouldn't have a voice, but I think we need to know what we know versus what we've drawn conclusions about, because if what we've been told is blatantly not true then we can process that differently as the disproval of an opinion
We can't get both sides of the story if one side is lying, so we have to trust our mentors and parents to be as objective as possible
to me, my own experience is objective, but to anyone else it isn't
so that's why it may seem like I'm not being objective about things
a lot of the complaints are about things that you can't objectively quantify, like motives, or what's "good" for the team
the problem is that a lot of these things aren't being recorded, and legally can't be unless everyone involved consents (but even asking is a good way to seem hostile off the bat), so there isn't a way to truly objectively say anything about any of this
my point is we want to be objective and we just don't have enough information to do that successfully right now, which is why we wanted to go to listen to learn.
but anyway
I think most of the seniors were there and afterward they told me that she didn't
don't remember as much because of it I guess.
Oh, I was in the car listening in on the meeting
then a parent meeting after
there was a student meeting right after school when coach got suspended
I don't remember that, was it a parent meeting or student meeting?
but otherwise I think that's fair
and there were students at the parent meeting who can confirm what she said, although they were seniors
I mean I'd say that last one should be pretty solid from your point of view, I think you were at the meeting she told us she apologized at
the issue I guess right now is that the viewpoints of Tipton from the students are very different from the viewpoints of Tipton that the mentors/parents have. We haven't had/taken the opportunity to reach out to her and try to communicate and compromise, and we haven't been told of the times that she has lied (and we don't have any proof), so we cannot logically draw any conclusions without others' opinions. We want to be as professional as possible and consider the options and the evidence we have, but we feel like we don't have any evidence of what's happened in the past and information on possibilities for the future (4H versus school).
e.g. the time she told all the parents that she apologized to all the students for not being more involved at the end of last year
she's demonstrated a willingness to be dishonest to look like the good guy before
I'm not willing to give her the benefit of the doubt anymore, really
Maybe she hadn't said that she had contacted you already. It's possible she just said that she planned on reaching out to you.
am
between 9-10
I got her email at 3:23 PM, when did you talk to him?
Gudor came back and said that she had already tried to contact you by the time Gudor and her talked
if he did it in an unprofessional way
she wasn't going to until gudor talked to her
It doesn't make sense that she fired coach for sticking up for you then tried to bring you back...
I don't think there's any other reasonable explanation given the timing honestly
I'm trying to keep straight in my head what has been directly told to us versus correlations we've made
keep in mind that's not something that anyone is going to admit, but the trend matches
What do you mean by "The truth"?
he sent a long and pretty reasonable email to tipton and scott logan on sunday afternoon (they noted in their email removing me that any questions should go to them) and on monday afternoon he was fired
ok really gotta go now bye
so messed up
the truth is that the last straw there was that he stuck up for me when I got removed
ok
Which I think was technically staff
He was still on payroll as coach
he was fired as coach though
he was never fired from staff, he retired
So then can we say that business with coach with re: audit == business with coach re: firing from staff position?
gotta run now
it was specifically in regard to his suspension
was that specifically in regards to the audit last year though? That seemed like SOP in hindsight if they were truly concerned about fraud
That was the official word during the investigation last year
What do you mean it's always been said is what I meant to ask
Clearly this is just personal conflict, that's not a good enough reason
Ref to Tim's observation.
<@U2KD3E39A> What do you mean by your last statement?
there was a difference in the two bans
I think that required an outside voice to convince her that it wasn't a good idea though
And it's always been said that the business with coach was never about student safety
Well, if she's willing to walk back the ban on you (Thomas) there's at least faint hope of walking back the ban on coach too.
I don't think it leaves any room for interpretation unless you count a complete reversal
I don't know
well the wording of the email is kind of absolute
There's a difference between a temporary "don't come on campus" and whether he'll be welcome back as a mentor; I get that they can easily go hand in hand but there could have been concern from administration about Steele's direct and immediate involvement in what is going on
there were five demonstrably false things that she said last night, but we can discuss those another time
I do think it's important to note that she did know the answer to the question of whether coach would be allowed back as a mentor even though she said she would find out, though
I suspect principals have a lot of leeway in the name of ensuring student safety.  Over the long term, due process may come into play.
then the next question is if its SOP to do that, but I don't think we can answer that on our own
just as they'd be in their rights to ban me or anyone else
yes
So they were (objectively) within their rights to do that?
yes
from a purely objective stand point, I would want to know what allows them to lay that claim. Could they do that to anybody that is not staff at the school?
it also unambiguously says "you are not welcomed to participate in any activity at the school"
forwarded to eli
I also have an email from district HR to coach that proves it
Yeah - when has there ever been security for a parent meeting?
interesting.
I wasn't one 
Ask any parent that chatted with the guard.
<@U2KD3E39A> Do you know that for sure? That speculation has been made but I haven't heard it confirmed
Ok.  I will take my cues from the students.  You all are why I show up.
It's a fact right now that we're still with the school, a vote has not been called. Doesn't mean some don't want to
There was actually a security guard posted to ensure that coach did not attend. Much weirdness.
That's from the student population; it sounds like the parents might have different ideas
For now it sounds like we're sticking with the school, a vote has not yet been called
i've since heard that coach was uninvited from the meeting ("don't come")
Thanks for the update.  So neither option was selected?
that was mostly stream of thought from last night so its not super coherent
The situation was that coach was removed from the team by decree of Tipton. At the parent meeting tonight, it became unclear exactly who made the final call, as she was not allowed to answer (she did this many times where she said she couldn't answer. We don't know the exact reason but we have to assume its legitimate). Many students met after school on property that Erin's dad had access to. We mostly discussed what we wanted to do at the parent meeting, and in the 2 and a half hours we had we decided that we wanted to sit and listen to everybody's point of view, and if we were going to ask questions they would be either personal questions, or questions agreed upon by the group so that it was clear that each student spoke for themselves. We did not have enough time to discuss questions we wanted to ask as a group, which was a mistake, as we were asked many times questions that we had for them which caught us very off guard. 
The meeting started at 7 in the BPC, where many parents, many students, many mentors, and Ross (who doesn't really fit into those categories) came. The PTSA board was there, Connie was there, the DeSilvas were there, but Coach did not come (I do not know if he was invited or not.) Tipton would not answer questions about why coach had been removed, or what the interaction was between her and Thomas DeSilva. We learned about two possible options for the team. One was staying with the school, and losing coach definitaly as a paid position, but we don't even know if he will be welcomed back as a mentor for the team as a mentor. Tipton said she would have an answer soon about that. The other option is to become a 4H team, which means that we would separate from the school. This would almost guarantee that we would lose access to the shop in the immediate sense, but there is a chance that we would be able to work on school property in the future. This option has not been researched much yet (and if it has, the results of said research were not shared with the group). We don't know if we would get the money that we have with PTSA if we split from the team, so that would have to be considered as well. As of right now, we are staying with the team, and we do not have an interim coach announced yet before we go through the hiring process.
For the hiring process, Tipton promised that students (note the plural) would have a seat on the hiring team. From what Tipton said, she made it sound like it would most likely be Gudor, Wilson, Ms. Jones (previous FTC coach) or Bowlin. She also mentioned the possibility of hiring from outside the current school staff. The other main point that was discussed is that there needs to be a Robotics ASB formed to manage the flow of money through the PTSA to the team. As of now (as far as I know) no decision has been finalized about how the ASB will be selected, and whether they will be elected by the students or not.
Also we're trying to keep most of this information within the team right now.
I wrote it after coming home last night
Source?
Ok
Get ready for some copy pasting and a wall of text
What happened at the parent meeting last night?
just trying to get a gauge from lots of different perspectives
how's everyone here feeling?
it's a little nebulous right now and really depends on how the 4H proposal ends up going
I get we would lose the shop
I don't know if you know about specifics but the one questions I have that's immediate is what stuff are we allowed to keep.
indeed
Strange days 
the tl;dr is 4H and then tipton doesn't have the authority to choose mentors, but the parents need to agree on it
which, as andy said, is very important for everyone's parents to be at
hinges on the parent meeting tomorrow
how long before we hear about it?
before everyone panics: there is a plan

which is another reason I'd prefer to use java, I think you'll all get a lot more mileage out of it
then they open sourced it
kotlin was made by JetBrains for mostly internal use I think
yeah, I mean I've heard of kotlin, mostly because intellij comes with plugins for it by default, but I've never actually seen it used anywhere
lol. I was mostly mentioning the Kotlin thing because of curiosity, hadn't heard of it before and was wondering if you had. If you haven't we probably shouldn't make a double leap this season
it's probably that
but maybe I'm just salty that a kid on the internet offended my delicate sensibilities ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
that's fair.
it's less that and more that he has more confidence in his opinions than he probably should given his background
in an ideal world his opinions on mentoring wouldn't affect his opinions on good programming language but I'll keep that in mind
yeah, I'd just take what he has to say with a grain of salt
that's an interesting view to say the least
he's definitely got some opinions
<https://www.reddit.com/r/FRC/comments/6ozxez/mentors/dklkmdo/> this thread
how so?
dude rustles my jimmies
ah
he is the team lead, was programming lead last year
this wouldn't happen to be their programming/team lead would it
java lambdas are easy enough imo, if we want singletons with a single keyword we can bring in dependency injection
The only other thing he's mentioned that caught my interest is golang-esque multithreading
there are other things he's talking about that they do too, it does sound cool but I don't know how much more useful it will be
and intellij has enough code generation built in that the standard java boilerplate isn't really that painful
that was the one I brought up, yeah
cons would be I don't think any of us know kotlin
"only real con imo is that there aren't as many resources out there for it, but we've not had that problem"
"so for pros, 100% java interop (but that's a bare minimum), it's much more concise and faster to write, there's a ton of boilerplate reduction (full object composition isn't even an extra line of code, single keyword singletons, function assignment, ezpz lambdas), it's' null safe meaning no null pointer exceptions unless you specifically allow them"
this is what he said:

**No it won’t
OK. We’ve been trying to keep this quiet.* But at 8 PM Eastern Time today, we’ll be releasing the teaser for the upcoming season.

FIRST Robotics Competition Twitter Feed
FIRST Robotics Competition Facebook Page
The teaser will be released simultaneously, or at least within a few seconds of each other, on all these links. Though only one, and I’m not saying which, will be showing the special extended ‘Director’s Cut.'**

Tablets and cameras were found
I have been told it will return to 6-9 for build season
yeah. I'm frustrated cause I know it will put a strain on the mentors but it's a decision from above that has already been worked back from 3:30
Ouch.  I will be there as soon as I can
<!channel> just a heads up to everyone; during preaseason robotics will start at 5 and end at 7:30.
:ok_hand:
Yeah I just checked with Bowlin too. 
If anybody was going to the shop organization thing, Bowlin hasn't heard back from coach so it's probably not happening
.-.
*squints at eli*
I'm sure they'll be fine until someone spills mountain dew on them
Rip business team 
pretty sure
Is that the biz room?
though coach said weeks but maybe something's changed
Olsens?
The last I heard about it the new Intro to Robotics teacher is going to use that room, but I never heard confirmation about that
think we'll probably be in ms. weeks's room
Bowlin said something about moving us
Do we have the programming lair this year 
who did their summer homework 
I'm going
doesn't mean we shouldn't help
I've actually tried out just about all the tools now so I have a clearer picture of what the options are
Shop != programming lair
yeah, Mr Bowlin mentioned a shop cleanup thing this thursday tho
the 12th
yeah we never really resolved java vs c++
First meeting is Tuesday right

we'll discuss this in detail in a more neutral forum

10/10 would work :ok_hand:

haha joke, java sucks
lets keep our values in a .java file
._. my bad
<@U1FAR4AJU> we did in 2016 though
Dude it was joke
<@U1FAR4AJU> most of our PIDs last year iirc were hard coded values either in the command or in Robot.h
and figure out what we can improve and what we can get rid of
one of the first things we should do is an architecture review of last year's code where we analyze the design decisions we made
I thought we were keeping it in a text file 
keep that in mind
huh. we should do that more then, dunno how well it would work for multiple people trying to work on different things but I think we could pull it off better
no
Is there a reason that didn't work well?
yes
<@U1F0LEQ3W> Have we tried storing PID values in text files before so that thye don't have to be recompiled?

How can I program this


unlikely
Are the google product forums more than just a graveyard?
nope. same deal
I'm trying chrome canary for the hell of it.
The only thing I don't know how to decipher is things listed as "Section" instead of "File"
Everything has full read access that it's trying to get to
Discussion of NTFS in my operating systems class was basically limited to "this exists, I hope you never have to deal with it"
I'm not entirely sure how file handles work in windows so this might be pointless though ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Alright
and their containing directories
go through the file handles it owns and check that the user that's running chrome has access to them
(I'm looking at the list that chrome.exe is open on)
How would handle tell me that it can't open a specific file?
although in that case you might find an info or warn event about it around the same time as the hang error
you might try using handle to see if it's stuck trying to open a file that it can't get to <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/handle>
so whatever is going wrong is probably a chrome problem then
never mind, reinstalling did nothing. same deal
reinstalling now. My dad says he's tried it before and it might work for a day then crash again. The only logs in event viewer are "Error" under id "Application Hang"
if reinstalling doesn't work, check event viewer for errors the next time it freezes
<https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!msg/chrome/40fxuq_vhjk/Z_7yhDUhAgAJ> seems possibly relevant
can't uninstall until all running instances are close :&lt; I'll just wait I guess
I'll do that real quick
yeah
Chrome?
did you already try reinstalling
maybe
may have been related to a permissions issue on the profile
Access is denied to killing even when running as admin?
I had that once but I don't remember how I fixed it
Download Process Explorer from Microsoft for a better look at what's going on
That's about the extent of my troubleshooting knowledge, good luck
Which makes me think it's a hardware issue, but only affecting chrome?
the really weird part is that the same issue existed on my dad's non functional previous all in one, the one he has now is a direct replacement

this is a gradle plugin that manages dependencies and generates a cmake file to handle the actual build
wait hold on, grade is java only right?
/figure out how boost testing works
the cmake configuration it generates doesn't include anything for unit testing though, so I'll probably need to figure out how 5499's project works with boost and stick them together
:cool:
yes
sick, but can u use it from command line

so did you just write a script to execute the wpilib deploy thing or is it more complicated than that?
oh ok
nathan go home
said no one ever 
but i like eclipse :-(
tucker go home
But the eclipse is on the 22nd, you have to use it until then
Fuck yeah
got code deployed with clion, confirmed not using eclipse next year
yeah I'll look for that
Like I said I'm pretty sure I have everything downloaded and installed. I don't think I have the build setting setup correctly, whenever I try to build I just get "make: *** No targets specified and no makefile found.  Stop."
should be a "toolchains" menu under preferences or project setup or something that needs to be pointed at your minGW installation
are you talking about the wpilib stuff?
help-&gt;install new software?
But I don't have eclipse configured correctly
I have everything downloaded and installed
<https://github.com/Skunkworks1983/Loading-Bar-Package>
I completely forget how to get eclipse setup to build with the toolchain
o
going to a synthesis event
making sure I have a build environment for our code by tomorrow morning
why eclipse though
Have you tried plugging the toaster in?
this is so great... trying to install the newest eclipse on a laptop, realized I needed jre on the first run of the installer. It managed to set some global flag that I don't have jre and just routes to a webpage now when I run the installer again.

You are going to cook a lion on a gradle?
eventually I'll get around to trying out CLion with gradle but my todo list is large and daunting
I'll look through it more tmr but Java looks way cleaner to be honest
Interesting. 
yeah
Was it legacy even in c++ then (just following previous years)?
robots are made up of subsystems, so `Robot` contains `Subsystem`s
`CommandBase` isn't really a reasonable place to put pointers to all of the subsystems because it's the base class for `Command`s
Finally getting around to looking at the java project a little bit. What's the reasoning behind consolidating CommandBase into Robot?
Wow
Whoa there
<@U1F0W3FFC> uploaded a file: <https://skunkworksteam1983.slack.com/files/U1F0W3FFC/F6BRRJTR7/image_uploaded_from_ios.jpg|hi thomas>
my charger is in my living room with the biscuit
ok
nope, just grabbed it today
oh, so you probably didn't have it 8 days ago then
it was at Ailis's house
bringing it to challenge air tomorrow
wait why do you have the go bag
The other one is in one of the lego robotics workshop laptop's bag
One programming laptop charger is in the go bag with me
k
Nah we're good
would be about half an hour
I could bring my charger down there if it's needed
Downloading driver station on a counselors laptip
Yee
is there a demo?
We have 16% on programming laptop and no charger 
Rip us
I think I have the one for mine
for my laptop?
Eyyyy <@U1F0LEQ3W> where's the charger for your laptop in the cabinet 
 ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
oops
oh, guess I only told coach
Nah Bowlin just noticed it was missing 
I'm out of town
do you need it for something?
:ok_hand:
it's in my living room
<!channel> it's gone 
What happened to slippery biscuit 
you can see what I mean in `UT_TankDrive`: if `Robot` had a `public static Drivebase`, then `TankDrive` wouldn't need to take one in its constructor, meaning there wouldn't be any way to pass that mocked `Drivebase` in for the unit tests
you can't mock member variables, so it's good practice to hide them and use getters instead in case you need to mock something for a test
testability
why the private subsystems?
it just works
no interfaces to maintain, no janky macros, no running on test servers
yeah. I think that's one of the biggest advantages
unit testing looks dope tho
although you did remind me that I forgot to add inner classes for the different varieties of constants
prevents spaghetti
no free-range variables or functions
gross
anything at the top-level global scope has to be a class
oh, that's a java thing
having robotmap be its own class seems a bit odd compared to just the global constants, but other than that looks pretty much the same as c++
the architecture choices I made were pretty deliberate, do you have questions about it?
looks neat, not sure about some of the architecture of the code but its whatever
I think you need to maximise a single roborio, so if need be, your rio can take on extra processing from the other robots on your alliance so everyone can get a +7% speed bonus
so the commands you're running don't really have an impact on the threadedness of the program unless you're doing the threading explicitly
Yeah
realistically though the scheduler is single threaded anyway and the network communication talking to the FMS/driver station has its own thread
would need to look into how the deployment script calls the JVM
technically maybe
Robo Rio de lágrimas
So could you in theory make the VM only have a single virtual processor on one of the real time processors on the roborio and use the other one for running vision, because if you are only executing one command you don't need two processors, right?
if I was running more than just one long-running command I would need to tell the scheduler to cancel anything that's running in the init methods, but I wasn't, so I was lazy
Or does the periodic function have something to do with that?
Why don't you have to disable auto or Tele? Does the schedular switch them on it's own based off the driver station?
(if you installed intellij you should be able to import the project straight from github and at least run my unit tests)
take a look at the source code and let me know what you think compared to C++ <https://github.com/trdesilva/JavaBiscuit>
:clap:
tools seem easy enough to use, although I did encounter a small bug on project setup
I got slippery biscuit running on java and I don't think it was too hard

No we are outside
Cause there are 3 ambulances outside and more people
Um so we're inside?
we're out back with trailer 
What?
never mind, we're in back 
look out ur window 
We're here, but nobody else is
who's coming to the field today?
sounds good. I'll probably be there around 10:45
May be a bit later, but we will be heading over there from the school very soon.
10:30
Is the practice field available yet or eta?
I put the laptops and the charger back in the programming drawer of the red tool chest
That'd be great, thanks. The chargers are probably with they laptops
I'll pick them up when we run by the school
should still be at school
Did anybody bring the 2 DS laptops home or are they still at school?
Looked, can't find it
Is anyone still there I think I left my charger
Heck
No. 
do we have arrangements with mclaughlin to keep our laptops ?
Thanks
As far as I know we're meeting first at school
Should I head to the school or directly to the practice field?
Take home the cardboard boiler target plz, and the fake gear lift setup with vision target, so we are sure to have them for summer. We can remount them on something portable.
Sounds good. 
Also, I know you guys already did this, but I'd like to do a round of post-mortem one-on-ones with everyone Thursday
Andy says we can get into the practice field, so those who are familiar should spend the last few meetings on vision

He redeployed over it and somehow it worked 
What was the issue?
fixed 
I don't have time to figure this out right now though
so it is right about no code running
Oh
the first one should be there if C++ code is running, the second should if Java is
?
So deploying isn't working correctly
I can't find either 
Was it my fault?
Which or both?
I bet its all three of those things
Yee
One of those two things?
Eyyy guess what's missing 
Oki doki
If not check if there's a file at /var/run/natinst/FRC_UserProgram.pid
SSH into the Rio and check if FRCUserProgram is running with `ps ax`
Java didn't take that long to install try running the 2017 update suite on it
K
I don't want to mess with anything Eriks doing 
Have you tried preasing the reset button on the Rio?
Ok so slippery is out of commission until you can fix it or is there something I can do <@U1F0WAUUS> 
Eclipse says I have a successful deploy but driver station says there's no robot code
Wait is your issue deploying or running the code? Because I could deploy I just couldn't get it to take the java
Needs a full 2017 update maybe?
I tried to put Java on it and it didn't wasn't running
Erikkkkkk
Oh I definitely broke it
Has anyone else had problems deploying to slippery recently

Hi Izzie - it's great to see enhanced communication between the subteams. Please scroll up for some thoughts on the swervebot design from a software (software mentor, anyway, with heartless disregard for the joys of Totebot) point of view.
Welcome
hi
DUN DUUUN DUN DUUUUUUUUUN DA DA DA DA DA DAAA DA DAAAA DUN DUN DA DA DA DA DA 
Welcome to Jurassic park
<@U5BS3Q282> has joined the group
<@U1F0P4FA5> has joined the group
Adding Izzie and Franco to help with communication between sub teams.
The more I think about it, the more I think ToteBot2/SwerveBot needs to be housed in some kind of a cage, maybe 1/2" mesh, onto which we can readily attach sensors and modules and easily run wires through. Any side (or top) of should be readily removable to be worked on separately, but rigidly held in place when attached.  A tiny smooth sided unibody case just doesn't make sense for prototyping and development. It's not as amusing but way more useful.
For those interested in vision, I'm really enjoying this guy's posts: <http://www.pyimagesearch.com/>

Only when you crap it up - seriously
And you guys wanted to kick me out of the slack
I do like this design + code integration tho, keep that up for sure
There is probably going to be a meeting about what is going to happen on Tuesday
Crazy talk sorry
Are you sure we could sit down? That's entirely new territory
We only have stand ups though 
Coordinate efforts
?
Time for a sitdown, sounds like
Whoever wants to
Probably
and are you going to be working with thomas on that or no?
super skunk?
Im actually designing a tank drive right now for super skunk, but as soon as im done with it ill work on getting a swerve drive design done and hopefully made. 
Mentors are hoping to rescue the practice field pieces btw - store until we find a home for it
But I see what you're saying.
Probably not going to be put to the test of an actual competition field
Less stuff to break is all I'm thinking
depends on which motor would be that + how much space we have inside of a tote (not much)
But 1 z motor vs 4 - just sayin
Thomas is keen to start on that I know
(tote bot 2.0)
Really depends on the game. This year 16 pulled it off pretty well so that's just something to keep in mind on top of everything else. However I believe they're are plans on an off season swerve drive project so that document is a good start for the math behind the code base
As opposed to all slaved together I mean
 Seems like the question is whether or not the "snake turn" capability is worth the extra logical and physical complexity of 4 independent z axes
Idk it is something that I used two years ago when I was programming my FTC bot, I had a lot of help though, but it can be done.
Excuse u
you can just *do it*
no reasoning
it's all real
well now it's on paper and you don't have to use logic
I've tried to logic that through before...I get weird looks at Ikea when I'm staring at the wheels off a spinning cart

Also, Tipton was listing important parts of the team, and she said 'programming, electrical, and software' which I feel puts a lot of pressure on us

also you've been developing C++ code in a Java environment all year anyway
But I love IntelliJ and ReSharper (for C#)
Dunno if CLion does cross compilation or not
License is for full version all products including CLion
which I haven't tried, but is for C++
they also make CLion
so excited to develop c++ code in a java editor!! woohoo

No idea if it works or not but the WPILib guy at Houston said it does
And then you'll want this FRC plugin <https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/9405-frc>
We've talked about switching from C++ to Java so I've set us up with free IntelliJ licenses (actually, the whole JetBrains tool suite) - email me at <mailto:brianstephenspratt@gmail.com|brianstephenspratt@gmail.com> and I'll hook you up with the license server.

can't tell if "very selective and they're all geniuses" is a compliment or insult...

Why do you eat everything 
:clap:
we ate them
:raised_hands::clap:
I left some of those horrible pink lucky sticks at the field for you
Okay cool
The plan was to start practicing at 6
Back to working on autos. If drive team is up for it we'll be ready in about 1-1.5 hrs
More like 4/10 but still
Ok not that much actually
5 minutes to an actual value
that's pretty good
&gt;2/3rds accuracy
Ok
I just started tuning the flywheel (autos took priority) so I'm still unsure
From what I was hearing yesterday it seemed like we didn't have time for practice 
Don't know. They're still working on the hopper back at school, latest they get back is 3:30 but there's stuff to do after that so I don't know. 
How much time do you guys need
I kind of left it up to them but I don't think anyone came to a decision
<@U1F0LEQ3W> is drive team coming over at some point today or no?
yeah
how about support for other IDE's

ok cool
Getting 1 chicken 3 asada and 1 lengua
Its food
lol thats all good
Just a heads up the taco truck is probably not going to get that specific but we'll try
Me: beef beans cheese rice guac lime cilantro
Nathan: whatever tucker got
Tucker: steak beans cheese sour cream guacamole
Joseph: rice beans chicken salsa cilantro cheese
In southpark
A taco truck
Where are you getting them?
O
joseph
Also who is jo
Yeah I think we have enough cash
everyone inc. tucker/jo/bowlin?
be astronauts
peanut butter
What burritos does everyone want?
I only have a debit card, can't pay you back directly
...?
If you got the dough we got the tubes
Should I ask the others?
Jo Tucker Bowlin Nathan and I 
Is it just you two?
100000000
How many\what flavor
Burritos would be hella
 Like Mountain Dew lucky sticks burritos?
You want us to bring anything?
Cool cool
We're on our way
Nathan and i are at the practice field, anybody else going to show up?

how do you not have a second period though
ok probably just going to wait for someone who knows what they're doing come 
which means finding one of those too
you'd also need to solder them onto the connector at the talon end
where might the wires for the shooter encoder be

ok 
noooo 
Not now...
can you ask him if he can come down to the shop and wire this encoder 
Don't text in class Mike

Tough end, but well played.  The code showed well, particularly given the limited time and other obstacles.  Nice job, programmers.
MEMEBALLS FTW
:-/
shooter motors are catching so the turret gets caught 
Hope we tweak that shooter tho
Good job! Clutch last gear
:paella: ftw
this gon b good
Gee whiz! That was fun. Good playing!
I'm wrestling with some insecurity issues in my life but thank you all for playing with me.
Well played. I salute you all.
yuuup gonna be hype

Are potentially a 3 gear auto alliance ?
Jeez
Just battery loss
Did we learn anything about that power loss from the logs?
Good luck this afternoon!
Good day overall though!

Looking now at kids
Did we restart robot code in that last match?
<@U1F0W3FFC> <@U1F1ETJM7> drive team is taking a lunch break after this match, figure out why we're wiggling unnecessarily

In the YouTube app this works for me: <https://youtu.be/rboWrrLRlKA>
Is the stream working for anyone else? It's not for me
We should have an auto that shoots flaming memeballs 
Those dang meteor springs
Nah man I think it's just the springs :/
Meteor caught the airship on fire causing an auxiliary chemical reaction on another robot
ITS LIT

Always wiggles?  Need video!
But that's ok because the wait is long enough
Also for some reason the switch isn't reading, so it does it every time

I like the sound of "hasn't missed yet"!
I'm a competent programmerrrrr
Other than the time the things were in the wrong order
The auto hasn't missed yet so we haven't really verified it, but it looks like it should work
Well done!

thx
there it is
:blank:
i have some important information
hey guys
Sounds proper
I cleaned the project and rebuilt, they came back, but git didn't find them so I think we're good
If project is well configured those .o files will be gone after a Clean
I think that did it...
Should work
Important one: Debug/**/*.o
Debug/**/*.o
.cproject
desktop.ini
.classpath
.project
.settings/
build.properties
build.xml
Debug/
Unit Tests
.gitignore:
Just don't check them in
Ok
You don't - linker needs those 
how do I keep it from generating new .o?
ok, removed all of the .o's but kept the directory structure
<@U1F0LEQ3W> uploaded a file: <https://skunkworksteam1983.slack.com/files/U1F0LEQ3W/F4MK1B7PH/Untitled.sh|Untitled> and commented: it's happy after I did this
If you copy src into Debug and remove everything that isn't a directory, that should do it 
Just did the same thing you did, looks like you need to recreate the directory structure of the project under Debug
Should be Debug, not src
Check your build configuration to see where build artifacts are supposed to be going
Also it's a bit weird that .o gets written into source tree - is that the pattern with other files?
Is there a src/Commands/Shooter directory?
repo is in a non protected directory (rw permissions for any program
Assembler messages:
Fatal error: can't create src\Commands\Shooter\cSpinUpShooter.o: No such file or directory
rebuilt
Deleted everything in Debug/
<@U1F0LEQ3W> trying to fix Debug and remove *.o from the repo
<@U1F1ETJM7> shared a file: <https://skunkworksteam1983.slack.com/files/U1F1ETJM7/F4KRPSW2V/everything_we_want_to_do|Everything we want to do>
Yup yup
yeah I know. Just want to list everything we want to do
Yeah but an alliance with two shots at the auto rotor might be more better off, if we are setting priorities 
hopper auto as well
Yeah, easy
a little shimmy
Maybe a gear agitator if we don't get a different gear collector to randomize relative peg position?
I agree
Really a side auto with shoot would be huge
right
we're not going to get much time with the robot with the new gear collector going on and the shooter motors moving
I'm looking for side projects basically, anything that isn't super necessary but would still be useful
Right
With or without I'm finr
Idk 
Both
...hit or lined up right?
Same for retrieval zone
On the far side it's hard for me to see if I've hit the airsip
but I dunno
not sure how much you'd use it on the airship
Hm
Yee
if you're square or not?
Lining up with airship
for?
Leds seem good
Yee thanks
thats fair. just wanted to check to see if anything would help
yes
Yes chute door
You da driver
*time
Checking with the camera wastes tome
occasionally but we have a human player to indicate that
I thought I was seeing gear delivery blocked by stuff on ground that driver didn't know about?
We need to make every part of the robot telescoping
I don't think I'd use it
not much we can do there unless we can program the robot to be taller
driver camera is a pretty serious context switch that should basically only be a last resort if we're completely lost, but we don't really get completely lost
right, just trying to think if theres a solution
squaring up is the easy part
alignment issues are left/right more than crookedness
Yes - esp for gear pickup
im thinking big leds for lining up or something
driver camera?
<@U1F0LEQ3W> anything that would help drive team visually?
maybe? I talked with dave, dont fully remember
right, and it should make it have less energy loss per shot
Belt drive allows 2 motors to not fight each other I think
yea
belt driven shooter is just a more lax pid
&amp; belt driven shooter, i heard
need to be ready for the floor gear collector
jeez I keep forgetting that was the idea
shooter PID probably can't be much better without mechanical changes
size can have occlusion problems
Yup
vertical position is probably the easiest and most consistent visual indicator of distance
same
*shudders* I don't know why i'm so against it but I just don't see it as giving us an accurate enough reading
we could just get a rough estimate from the size of the boiler on screen?
nah
that would require lidar which we've never even tried to wire
I don't see it happening but if we have time (lol) we'll try it
maybe use that as an input for our shooter pid? idk
we could try finding distance to the boiler from the pis
Have a good time
Work out sonar
gear placement vision
theres gotta be some stuff
anything else?
no
are we meeting tomorrow?
Probably
if the answer's no thats fine but I want to see it and understand where you're coming from with it
<@U1F0BJN5U> do you have time to go over that auto tomorrow so I can help perfect it before testing so we reduce fiddling time?
putting switch on turret so we can automatically reset the turret pos @ start match
better shoot pid
hopper auto + shoot
Testing side gear auto
boiler vision tracking
<!channel> Even though we don't have robotics until Monday, we need to hit the ground running (3 days, 2 of which realistically at the practice field). What does everybody want to get done by Glacier?
Oops.  Undesirable.
radio fell off 
Rest of match less good. Battery unplugged?
Nice auto in 13!
i think we're reading one switch position on the wrong port also 
when selecting autos we should put the switch to the position farthest from the status light just to be safe

During. Just walk out
Are we going to the practice field before or after team meeting? 
coach kinda wanted earlier but was hesitant because of dinner being provided
think out of bag time is going to start at 6, but ask coach tomorrow
you're not here already?
What's the plan for practice field time tomorrow? When are we headed over!
list of things we need to do on comp bot tomorrow in approximate priority order:
1. make sure gear auto still works
2. check turret/shooter setpoints for new autos
3. set setpoints by alliance color
4. add ramping back in to shooter PID (use Tanvir's implementation or do it in hardware; see page 48 of the Talon manual)
5. use auto selection switches
6. drive straight with encoders
7. make new turret position buttons work
Could be useful:<https://github.com/killmous/git-rekt>
pass control of programming over to a United Nations subcommittee
remove vote functionality
cant rename it now
make eli push his code to base
we're in too deep
rename AutoBase to cAutoBase
Rename all files to variations of cHaveAGoodTime.h
ok this time, kill bella instead
kick bella

Github is yelling at me to commit all my changes, despite not having uncommitted changes, so I'm going to go ahead and try that tomorrow. The gear pathing is on the MikeGearPath branch though
Spiffy - Eli can you review, since you guys have both thought about this?
I'll make a pull request
Let's have dead reckoning side lift auto code ready to deploy just in case
lol
school. we're promised a robot by the beginning of meet tomorrow tho 
School or practice field tonight?
Erik and I are a miss for today as well
I won't be at robots today
If we can get plexi behind the lifts that might matter to the sonar - plywood is probably a bit more dead
Field immediate needs are 2 more lifts, and properly located+tilted high goal.  How they actually look is unimportant until we get to vision but location must be accurate.  Andy is building lifts I think.  We can just nudge the whole boiler 3 inches into the field if we don't want to recut the hole in the top, and don't ever plan to drive up to its front.
Not sure why we haven't been seeing them more often really
gitignore doesn't work on files that are already added to the repository and the .o files were added January 3
It's a shame that coach doesn't want us using the RPis if we're not completely ready with everything, but I understand the reasoning. There's a small chance that the pis could have caused an issue early in the day but we don't really know. I think that as long as we can get the practice field more accurate (and that's on us to make sure that happens), we can tune it as well as we can and then test during setup at Central.
So I'm not super happy with the process that got us to "no RPi for you" status - especially the fact that you guys weren't part of it - but taking a step back I realize it doesn't actually change the mission. We need to have failsafes in place regardless, and that means autos that can deliver gears and shoot fuel even when RPi's are on fire, and even when the sonar sensors are dangling from broken wires. The order of tasks is unchanged: dead reckoning no sonar, dead-ish reckoning with sonar, and finally with vision.  I'd think that would all be the same code, with logic to deal with dead subsystems like sonar or vision. So heads up, carry on, kick some butt.
That's what gitignore is for, for sure
we should get rid of those .o files
"coincidentally"
use base
oh, coincidentally, base is now the default branch and master is protected so it can't be messed with
By optimizing as many routines as possible without losing user friendliness, Notepad++ is trying to reduce the world carbon dioxide emissions. When using less CPU power, the PC can throttle down and reduce power consumption, resulting in a greener environment. ~<http://notepad-plus-plus.org>
code is now on base
<@U1F1ETJM7> yes
note: in cmotor, make sure to intialize m_timestall
thats fair

about what?
oh that makes way more sense
talking to coach
rip
<@U1F0LEQ3W>
<@U1F0LEQ3W> pls
because i means implements
and iMaster implements cMaster right?
You could call it "/b/"
we need to make two new branches: iMaster and cMaster
and make a new one called masterA
we can rename the current one to master1
can we rename branches?
so <@U1F0LEQ3W> I should branch off of my most recent commit on HEAD?
never mind
b for bella
(b for branch)
how about bMaster
how about instead of "master" we have "Master"
:benton_irl:
lol HBN
master_backup_backup_backup_backup_backup_backup_backup

at work we have a new-master
not saying this is a good idea, but
base?
what should I name if its gonna become default?
thats fair
so basically I think we make a new branch and make it the new default

I'm already sick


please get me sick
I'm not that sick, mostly exhaustion and stuffy nose, but definitely don't want to get anyone sick.
That's sick :the_horns:
Don't get us sick man
I might be able to make it over to the practice field as well if we do go there
tho*
I'm not going to be at robots today, wasn't at school cause of sickness. I plan on at least dedicating 6-9 working on robots to
I hope so - would like to get busy on autos
Will we be at the practice field today?

Pretty sweet seeing that auto gear btw 
Either way no game video, I hear
actually maybe. we don't know
we don't think that the power draw was actually an issue

Do the laptops have the most current version of master
builds on master
On master, don't know if it works, somebody should check that
The laptops are in the tool chest, I have an Ethernet cable
Robots is now
so what's the plan for tonight? robots or no robots 
Do we have laptops charged and Ethernet cables packdd
Putting stuff on my branch now
<@U1F1ETJM7> what about your stuff
I still have some changes I'm working on 
not quite yet, regarding master 
Everything packed?
Is master up to date?

Cool cool
Ok
BTW we are down two rPi now - one is smoked and other has borken camera connector.  I'd feel better if we had spares in the pit, I think coach may have some intended for balloon bots.  We could swap the one with bad connector at least
Some of us will be gone setting up for comp
Are we meeting Friday?

Did we decide what direction the leads should be facing on the camera? 
I'll be there - meet at skül?
Not sure when I'll be in tonight, have a lot to do at work
One was on comp bot already, other is now
I think they matter less on comp bot than practice bot, really
Mounted in pi boxes
Then there are at least 2 within 50 feet of you 
Yeah 
Where is all this happening?  Shop?
Pretty sure we handed off the comp bit pair already
But I think there's just one
I expect so - don't have it here at my desk
<@U2KD3E39A> are all the pis in that kit? 
Autocorrek 
Pi boxes
There are 4 installed in public boxes tho
Your call - wherever they do most good
Do you want us to take them off the practice bot
I will momentarily
Ask electrical?
I thought they were already installed - must be somewhere in the shop
<@U2KD3E39A>  <@U1F0WAUUS> which pis and where are they
Wdym
That's not helpful
Both if we have them there I guess
We've got the comp bot out of the bag, do you want any pis installed

Do you have practice bot yet?   They are waiting for Mr. Bowlin before unbagging.
There'll be practice field time tonight

Oki doki
can someone @ the prac field now make sure the practice boiler gets to the school ?
I'm going to go ahead and guess we're not going to the practice field today

Thanks Rachel :expressionless:
apparently we love our programming subteam
OK - I just wanna be sure I don't ding anything, will diff manually
wasn't in git because system-dependent paths

yep

im sorry what

ick, but ok i guess - is there a diff function?
yeah we did so we source control it thru slack
I thought we had some trouble with .cproject being git controlled?  I'd for sure prefer to have be standardized.
or everyone just makes the change themselves
yeah
to slack
gotta push .cproject probably
<@U1F0LEQ3W> now that we're at no-warnings build state I'd like to enable -Werror - but its not clear to me how that change flows to the team?

I'm having trouble installing whatever can I get some help? 
I'll be available on slack/phone/whatever

Gyro is input to a PID that adjusts the ratio between motor speeds and encoders were just used to tell when to stop
I thought that's what we were doing
also benton should have a mount done by the start of the meeting (he claims)
as an error feedback for the pid
for the auto
Or do you mean gyro only without encoders?
You mean for testing?
<@U1F0LEQ3W> if the gyro was working, could we use that for an error value and just not have motor feedback?
Thanks 
It's in the oi
I left my laptop charger at the practice field, does anyone have it?
Things better tonight?
Yep
You guys still at it?
That certainly seems productive.

2 hours
Bag open at 3 <@U1F0LEQ3W> <@U1F0LEEE9> 
Benton is talking sense into coach right now about the hopper
No time to test other shit
Shooter encoder functioning?
Were the pis talking?
That does complicate things.  Encoder on turret functioning?
We haven't unbagged yet 
Like I said everything is fucky
Nope
Drivebase encoders OK?
Today they're doing driver practice until 4-5
Yesterday around 5
Descriptive.  What time did we get to the practice field?  
Why
Electrical is giving me shit
Everything was fucked
What happened last night?
I'm going to be at school around 2:30
Just talked with Benton, prob 3 hours
We'll probably be done with practice around 4-5
Not sure
They probably won't need us until later
2 or 3 hrs?
I don't think I can be there at 1
Check to see what they're doing with it
At 1, but someone should be there and make sure things that need to be tested get tested
Everything was fucky we didn't get far
At 1? For mechanical only or?
No 
did you guys get the turret tested last night?
But they're taking the robot out of the bag at school around 1, somebody should be there to test jt
We dunno
How long is practice going to go?
Yea 
Are you guys still working?

Alright, I need to pull from master then, bc I'm not seeing it. Thanks
AutoBase.h
const eAlliance alliance = Red;
Is there? What's it called?
remove const tho
it has been confirmed
there's a global variable in autobase i think
Is there any way currently in the code to determine whether we are on the red or blue alliance? The auto for gear placement will need to vary based on whether the field is mirrored.
We're going to the practice field sometime after lunch
I'll be in after lunch. Are we still at school?
Practice field + comp bot maybe
Meet at school 9:30 or 10
OK?
what's the plan tomorrow ?
It's always been brken
We're just using it for the first time
Ourselves
It's not suddenly breaking
who can we blame
Why is everything suddenly breaking
???
When we spin up the shooter the OI forgets the buttons exist and then the shooter doesn't stip
Sorry I'm not there today, coach said we weren't meeting
The drivebase is squirrelly but it's ok
Yes
Fires extinguished, does it work
No
Did you? Lol
Did anyone mess with the left CIMS in the code 
I think it's something with encoder values rn
Voltage is fine
Voltage?
Hm
How far not up?

Also, we keep dropping robot comms :/
Just something to look into tomorrow 
It runs 
Everything just blew up at work, <@U1F1ETJM7> can you troubleshoot
Also, a log fell into the robot 
It was all the waybup
Have the belts skipped?
Was it all the way up when you turned it on?

A series of very precise lightning strikes seared the word “OMEN” into the rust-red sand of the Sonora Desert; scientists blamed “phytoplankton”.
Pieces of paper with the word “OMEN” written on them fell from the clouds. A beached whale was seen in the night sky. Babies left unattended began to roll slowly, but unmistakeably, uphill.
Rivers flowed uphill. A new star was seen in the night sky. A butchered pig was found to have the word “OMEN” written on its liver in clearly visible letters.
In retrospect, there had been omens and portents.

I got it to work
The code on the practice bot doesn't work and the code currently on master doesn't work?
stop texting in class tanvir
No phones in the shop
 I'm not in class I'm in the shop
Stop texting in class
do you have an earlier version that isn't terrible
it doesn't build and I need to deploy code
eli your code is really broken
We should get a picture of the priority list so that we don't lose if if anybody comes in and wants to use the white board
where did they come from cotton eye merge conflicts
where did they go
where did these come from
that awkward moment when you randomly get merge conflicts
blame ailis
CLOSE THE DOOR
since i cant chime in
You can merge later
That's fine
i'll delete it
whoops already made a new branch
Make a new branch off master for this once Eli has merged, we don't want this ending up in the main codebase
oki doki
One for switching the left and right joysticks, one for removing a cim from each side of the drivebase, and one for each encoder
Need a fourth joystick in the OI with 8 buttons, which each knock something out when pressed
How do you want me to "selectively disable" the robit
(they almost certainly wont let us bring it there until they do)
Need to fix up the turret and drivebase before we can go to the practice field probably
Yep
So meeting is at RAHS tonight?
Gotta learn them fancy moves
Love sulfating me some defense
Lol OK
We'll have defense to simulate defense
We've got 2016 bots to simulate defense
Drive in a straight line even if you're being defended
Also we could do like multipliers to the joystick inputs to simulate defense
but oki doki
Interesting
sounds sketch
"Selectively disable"
Selectively "disable" parts of the robot for practice dealing with a broken robot during matches without accidentally actually breaking the robot
What's the tool?
Working on cleaning up my code
&gt;.&gt;
shhhhhh
(I.e. not during class)
As soon as you guys can get together to make it
When do you want that list
I can work on that, I've nothing to do
In addition to the competition code, I have a driver training tool that I'll need someone to make in a separate branch
Eli, we need your branch cleaned up and merged into master so we're all on the same page
Make a list of things that need to be done (including both coding and testing) and sort by priority for the first district next week
Probably that too
We need to start tonight with triage
Did the belts get fixed?
Mechanical may want to finish fixing the shooter and get bumpers on before anything else happens with the robot
BTW if you go early plz take the cardboard boiler and gear spike setups, and the roll of retro reflective tape (but do NOT let anyone stick it onto the boilers at the field until they've been painted some plausible shade of steampunk brown)
What's the plan for tonight?
why we use unsigned double :upside_down_face:

Good luck with Bag day!

We won't be going to the practice field
If anyone has work to do that doesn't require the robot or vision systems on the robot, the school opens at 9am tomorrow. If you want to help another subteam, check with them first.

yes thank you for your ever lasting cynicism
Very Constructive of you.  If I ever said anything nice about you, I would now, but of course I don't.
i was getting mad so I had to do something
Sounds like it shouldn't be too long.  Thanks for keeping things moving.
We're 10 wires away and the hopper
I was in there the entire meeting building and wiring
K.  Thanks for hanging out.  You folks are great.
Coach said 10
What time do we start tomorrow?
Coach kicked us out
They're not done wiring it
To confirm our auto routines are perfect now that we have the robot?
trust me 
just another 45 
I assume you have the robot and it is really cool.
It has been an hour since the last time it would be 45 minutes.
That sounds like hardware.  I don't sully my hands with such concrete pursuits.
how fast can you build a robot
k.  Anything I can help with?
still "working"
They still working on it, or did things fold up until tomorrow?
The limits on what else goes in the bag are pretty lax as I recall.
I don't remember any rules against it.
i don't think theres anything in the manual against that
I think we will have to put small holes in the bag so they can breathe.  And food and water into the bag.  Also a bucket.
idk man they're pretty legit
They might have been exaggerating though
that is mildly concerning
I asked Victor and Isaac when they'd be done with whatever they're working on and they said 7 days.
"no no this time its really gonna be 45 minutes"
It'll be done in 45 minutes
Robot?  It has been 45 minutes.:grinning:
please stop nathan
-bella
:ok_hand:
ok.
i mean theres a lot of shade its hard to see
i can assure you i can see them on my computer
can you not see them?
they're there
De nada.  Why the "mock" routines?  (I might know if they had headers that explained...)
gracias
Working on it.
yes please review my pull request : &gt;
I am missing all the fun.
until they kick us out like last night
I get it.  How late are things going?
everytime we ask electrical theyre like "45 minutes i promise"
no no its a quote
Don't make promises other people have to keep.  Does Nathan need review on a pull rqst?

guess who lied and told us we would get a turret
us
hey guess whos getting a turret
It'll just be another 45 minutes
nvm
Ugh
45 minutes
Bummer.  Do we have an ETA?
gud joek
surprise :tada:

Any progress?
I have the rpis - will take to electrical

thanks
ok sick
which is it
Utility
of the three categories being: interface, utility, or subsystem
Service
ok, so
Not a command
PID input
looks like a command
At a guess it's a pid for the udp
is it a command or...
PID input based on values from UDP
anyone know what pidudp is ?
changing directories of files is driving me crazy :upside_down_face::upside_down_face::upside_down_face:
prob same
What time do we start sat am? Usual or earlier?
Gear stations 1and 3 are mirrors of each other
Wait was thinking turret but still same idea
Way
Nope - it's going to be wrong for half the matches if it's wrong at all, but I don't think it will be wrong either wat
(can't do centered)
<@U1F0WAUUS> <@U2KD3E39A> Do we care if the gear camera is mounted left of center or right of center?
ok, i'm working on testing the gear collector code on an actual mechanism (yay!), but i'll check that out soon
I'll might also be gone getting dinner when you get here
Ok, Eli's leaving for dinner and will be back in an hour
I'm leaving work soon
The things I listed earlier are the things we need to get done, so any of those that no one else is doing
pls send help
ive hit a wall with unit testing, anything else I can do?
I think I missed something here
:+1::skin-tone-3:
thx
got em
?
chute door?
Yes
there is much box
Pretty sure
In a box buried
we looked
its not there

Ok I got the gear ratios, should I upload to slack or just put it in the code and push to git
Think that covers what we need to do today
I'll go talk to design
Find gear ratios/wheel diameters and put them in code
Also figure out our conversions from motor turns to outputs
I'll talk to desivla right now bout that

Re color sensor - electrical owes us a gizmo to multiplex them since they share same i2c address
Navx definitely has some disadvantages, like weird reset behavior and an overly prescriptive API, so we should see if the other gyro is better
That's the question
Why would we want i2c gyro?
Test bang bang shooter control vs PID
Get automatic gear scoring working
See if we want to use i2c gyro instead of navx and how to get it on the bus
Figure out how we're going to talk to two of them at once
Hey guess what other desilva just said we should do
Also need to see if we're talking to the color sensor right
sweet sweet
Eventually
Cool cool.
Are you coming in today?
Tanvir's got making the shooter only have one PID by slaving one talon to the other

Electrical can wire us up a guitar hero guitar for control if we want that
exactly.
If they really needed to know they would have figured it out themselves 
sure. We should really get on the whole telling electrical things thing
Red v blue, and position 1,2 or 3
I liked the physical switch idea, don't know if electrical heard of it
and what we actually want for auto selection
I'm with you, but we need to figure out if electrical knows that
but up to you guys
my opinion is that smart dashboard sucks
I'm thinking rng for the arguments to the commands
^
I say rng
if we're doing it another way (smartdashboard), are we ready to accept SD input?
if we're doing physical selection, have we told electrical we need that?
<@U1F0LEQ3W> <@U2KD3E39A> <@U1F0LEEE9> have we worked out how we're doing autonomous selection yet?

We're just doing a branch per person this year so we can do it commit by commit
And it's easier on the reviewer.
Both, ideally.  Reduces merge conflicts.
Branches or commits?
Let's try to keep branches to s single purpose- a lot of changed in there and I'm not sure they're what you wanted me to review
Ok left some reviews
I'll take a look
yeah there already is one it's called "Nathan: fixed messenger" or something 
Can you put up a pull request?
is someone available to review my code?
<@U1F0LEQ3W> coach just told me; turret has a gear ratio of 9.14:1
Hail science!
praise the flying spaghetti monster: messenger is fix !!!
We're fine here, if we get stuck we'll go home and wait for tomorrow
I've got some things to do tonight, so if no one's going to be desperately spinning their wheels for the next four hours otherwise, think I'll skip
If you want to come over we'll stick around and keep working
He's been at it for hours
not much is going on, having trouble with messenger but should be resolved soon (hopefully)
Leaving work soon, anyone need help enough that I should come in?
I'll try to get to it today if I have time
Its Tanvir, Nathan and I right now here
With the "Debug" and "Unit Tests" build configurations
Could one of you guys try checking out the unit-tests branch and building it with the .Cproject config I posted
estoy
who's coming today?
I'll probably get in between 10 and 11
When do we meet on Sunday?
we should all think about making a big to-do list so we can know what needs to be finished in this last 12d

i was forced to say these things. it was extortion
this is a funny
teehee
why don't we hook up a pidcontroller for the values of the turret's pid control? :slightly_smiling_face:
Just occurred to me, we may need different PID tuning on turret depending upon whether or not shooter is spun up.
I've been doing some trajectory stuff but not actually touching the motors
I'm not texting 
 Erik stop texting in class
I was working on gear detecting, nothing with motors 
I think Erik was working on that
The manual turret command runs talons, so no
Is that actually driving the servos on totebot yet?
Tanvir's been doing shooter code and Bella did a command for manually moving the turret
who's been working on turret/shooter code?
Sorry
 Sort
Also if you leave a bunch of cracker crumbs on the floor, grab a vacuum from the shop and clean them up (Mike)
Someone forgot their battery pack, I'm putting it in the cupboard with the other stuff
Info on using static IPs on the field - we should update our spreadsheet and code:  <http://wpilib.screenstepslive.com/s/4485/m/24193/l/319135-ip-networking-at-the-event>
OK
We have school
Unless otherwise noted yes
Is there a meeting today?
Though h264 frame rate is not constant, from what I read
Yeah I think raspivid defaults to 25fps
oh?
16 is in the range of realtime, so probably not too different from what you perceived 
no, I'm just surprised becasue it seemed a lot higher on playback
Your FPS was higher?  I got those numbers by playing back vid for single cycle BTW
weird
That's playback on a test vid actually
I haven't had a chance to add threading yet. I'll try to get to that later tonight after the homework I put off last night.
oh because you don't have an ir filter on
16 fps on windows?
Haven't put it on the rpi yet, but here are some numbers with the github-eli code on my windows box: 16FPS with no changes, 54FPS with all debug+graphics off, 57FPS with no graphics or UDP send. That will scale down on rpi I expect, but with UDP on a seperate thread I'm hopeful it will be fast enough. Now I gotta go actually find that rpi
logging &amp; command stuffs 
what's everyone else working on tonight?
Cool
I have an old rpi2 at home, that should be a good acid test for FPS goals
Spiffy
It will be updated later tho
It's all on github on the Eli branch
Your Python image processing plus UDP transmit
Post what code? 
Post your code where I can get at it and I'll look at it tonight
The counter was buggy from the start so we removed it, I'll re implement it today
FPS?
Not very
How close to fast enough are we?
So simple
Yes, but do simple to try
Right but the code to implement and manage it is
That is, threading is not actually Python specific
Python makes that easy - and I think you'd want it in c++ too, where it's less easy
My concern is writing very python specific code without knowing if we're using Python or not (ie threading code)
It comes down to performance - my instinct is that clean Python code should do fine - most of the heavy lifting is done by opencv and numpy, which are C++ under the covers
<!channel> we need to decide really soon if we're going to do python or c++ for opencv
Interesting
It's what I had to do to get my frame rate up when I was playing with this.
With the current target info in a shared global variable, and one thread updating target info as fast as it can, and the other thread pumping it out over UDP as fast as it can.  (No rpi needed for development, of course)
Hey vision pythonistas - have you looked at using threads to decouple frame processing from transmission of target location data?
Anyone at the school today
Nice
Das good
2nd VRM is allowed per Robot rule R56
okay
I'll be at robotics late
I'm here
Anyone still at the school?
Otherwise you can search the project for it and it should be pretty straightforward to fix
Compiler output should have the offending definition and where it was first defined
Yeah also check header guards ^ (look them up)
Include file used more than once , maybe?
That may have been my bad
Check cPIDUdp
anyone have any ideas why when rpi_ip in robotmap is a const char* i get an error for multiple definitions?
Optional meeting at the school
Is there something that isn't tryouts today?
who's coming today?
Gonna be late to robots, presenting at the mof
oh lol ok
My mom is still trying to figure out what she's serving 
why?

So it looks like we will need to build our own 950nm IR lights out of individual LEDs.  Nobody has premade ones in stock that I can find. Grrr.
I emailed the spreadsheet link to coach
it's been removed in the current version of the git repository, which makes git delete it when you merge from master
BEFORE YOU MERGE FROM MASTER, back up your .cproject file
And what IP addresses we'll use of the robot
Also with a place to declare what UDP ports go where

steps for running unit tests:
1. `scp` your test executable onto the test machine using the linux-test.pem private key; for example:
```scp -i Downloads/linux-test.pem src/eclipse/2017Steamworks/test/Test  <mailto:ubuntu@ec2-52-32-208-36.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com|ubuntu@ec2-52-32-208-36.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com>:/home/ubuntu```
2. `ssh` onto the test machine:
```ssh -i Downloads/linux-test.pem <mailto:ubuntu@ec2-52-32-208-36.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com|ubuntu@ec2-52-32-208-36.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com>```
3. use the `runTest` command on your test executable:
```ubuntu@ip-172-31-18-124:~$ runTest Test 
Running main() from <http://gtest_main.cc|gtest_main.cc>

Yeah, especially for Windows Python is a great way to get into openCV (or anything really - there's an amazing range of libraries for Python).  Could even use in production on rpi if performance is adequate. Though as project complexity rises I'm less keen on Python, but maybe I've just not found the right tools.

theres gonna be a ton of math this year... I love it
we can do math for angle based on dHeight from the cam
Assuming we can see the spike in IR it will be an excellent marker for approach angle

we talked about doing that last year but didn't get around to it
It would be super useful if we could store all raw video from rpi cams during matches for later use in tuning the vision systems. Could be done local to the robot with cheap USB drives.

Mr. Vader might be getting another one? idk
I'm not sure
do we need more?
not that I know of, but you can ask coach to order them
should I order one or are there some on the way?
trying to figure out what kind of power supply to use with the rpi
fair fair
or Brad saw that there was official code for it and decided that meant he wouldn't have to deal with it
strange
something like that
so basically ctr told wpi "dont include it"?
not by WPI, CTR decided they wanted to put out their own library
is CANTalon no longer officially supported or?
thats weird, whys that?
<http://www.ctr-electronics.com/control-system/hro.html#product_tabs_technical_resources> download "CTRE Toolsuite (No Installer)" and follow the instructions in the readme
<!here|@here> the CANTalon class has been removed from WPILib, so if you haven't already, you should download the new library that has it
rip nevermind the pictures didn't send

True
I'm not sure it would perform any better than just measuring the angle with a regular camera
For three pointers it could help
Yes. I would only start looking at the kinect if you have a need for a depth sensor.
Tho it may be late to start looking at a new system.  We know how to use RPi from last year.
$100 problem then.
Second, is hardware issues. You're probably going to want to use the kinectv2 as the limitations on the v1 are rough.
Part of what I was looking at is a package that covers a lot of that.
First challenge is going to be processing.
:salt:
Besides being scarred from abandonment in my tender adolescent years? Perfectly fine.
Are you ok Eli 
In all seriousness how come?
As always I would defer to Thomas. 
I think it's a pathway to a good deal of wasted time. Wonderful off season project though. 
When he abandoned us, as if we were a dog that was worth no more than a stray
Goodness he says, as if he doesn't fully understand the pain we felt
So what's the beef with Kinect?
Goodness 
When you left us the first time and shattered our hearts
*yet you never said goodbye*
&lt;_&lt;
I never left. Always watching. 
HE RETURNS

There's a reason it's vapor ware technology. 
The kinect is deceptive. 
No. 
I guess that even if we own it, it's a fair chunk of change against allowed total cost of parts.  Still might be worth it tho - you can do some fairly high level stuff with it fairly easily, from what I've heard

Let's get 4 kinects and have 360 vision
do we?  cool
Don't we have a Kinect in the programming cabinet ?
and I can bring in a Kinect
Interesting vision option: Kinect and this software package.  I went ahead and got the 5 free licenses if we want to play with it.  <http://www.roborealm.com/FRC2017/>

Where are we going for lunch?
&amp;Full$team^Ahead!
From what I remember the brownout code worked pretty well, but we didn't want it because we wanted to go super fast.
Eh at least the Blame finally worked out for us
Nice to know we're loved tho
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Just not any severe issues I guess
So what was coach talking about?
Or the radio
Brownouts aren't the biggest deal. Brownouts are the result of builtin managing of subsystems so that the roborio doesn't die all the time and restart
No for sure we have brownouts
And we didn't want to include code on master that could potentially disable subsystems if it wasn't perfect
But no brownouts?
i.e. I just don't think all the bugs ever got worked out
Heh
...Didn't work out too well.
Cool
Instead of the bot just shaking and dying
So that if we dropped below a certain voltage (I know thats not current keep your pitchforks away) we would start disabling subsystems in a controlled manner
How works that
Yeah we tried to implement brownout control
Current limiting in software?  There's so much I don't know
:cold_sweat:
...run and hide
I think that's us
He reffered the people to programmers
(or see what our drivebase is probably going to look like)

That seems like a better choice.
I wouldn't be surprised if we stuck with rpi processing; design decision we'll have to make
I think so, but I was more talking about the beta version of WPILib as a whole
Looks interesting- the roborio does the image processing?

 Wait I thought there wasn't a meeting this week
I agree with everything but the eclipse thing. It's actually better (gasp) at arduino, it doesn't store stuff on network drives unless you explicitly tell it to
<!channel> If you are still trying to get the Arduino bot moving, I have figured out how to get a school laptop to compile and upload in a fairly reasonable amount of time.  Sorry I didn't do this a few weeks ago:

If you are running the Arduino IDE, quit out of it.
In Windows Explorer, copy the Arduino directory from c:\Program Files(x86) to c:\
Now you have a directory c:\Arduino - open that in Windows Explorer and create a new directory c:\Arduino\Sketchbook
Now start the Arduino IDE as c:\Arduino\Arduino.exe
Use the Files | Preferences menu item to open the Preferences dialog
At the top of the Preferences dialog, it gives the current location of the sketchbook, something like \\shares\studenthome\S-1234567890\Arduino - make a note of that.
Change Sketchbook location to "c:\Arduino\Sketchbook" 
Use Windows Explorer to copy everything in \\shares\studenthome\S-1234567890\Arduino into c:\Arduino\Sketchbook.
From now on, do all your work on files in and under c:\Arduino
On Erik's school laptop with this configuration, initial compile and upload of a moderately complex robot program took 36 seconds.
A small change to the program took only 8 seconds to recompile and upload.  That starts to be a reasonable turnaround time.

Let's see if we can't have all 6 robots working on Tuesday!  The cake will be delicious and moist.

I suspect we will want to do a similar thing for Eclipse and the RoboRio.

One thing to remember is that moving off the student network share comes at the cost of "no more automatic backup".  So get in the habit of emailing yourself diffs, or setting up a private github repo, or something.  When we're in season we can't be worrying about lost laptops etc.
Hayel yeah
:tada::clap:
Thank you guys 
Psh
nah, I just unjinxed it by pointing it out
see thomas I didn't jinx it
Nice!

Is the robot moving?
Heeeeey
IT WORKED!!!:tada:
It's a coping mechanism 
Shhhhhhh
why'd you have to go and jinx it
I think it'll work this time 
:partyparrot:
I did
^^
make sure you select the port in the IDE before you upload
Changed USB port. Comes up as  arduino. Gonna build again
if you do, try plugging the arduino into that and check if the IDE will see it, and if it won't, check if device manager knows what it is
do you still have the IDE on that surface laptop you had the other day?
ok, so windows isn't recognizing it
Usb port*
Different port?
I don't have admin to change things either 
It showed up as unknown device. Windows is unable to install driver software 
and could you go into device manager and make sure the arduino shows up as an arduino
It finished. Same error as before 
I'll try that when it's finished uploading 
could you go into your settings (File &gt; Preferences &gt; Settings) and enable verbose output during compilation and upload?
D:
Eh it's going on 13 for me and it's not even past 25%
yeah <@U1F0L9PEK> it takes 10 mins to compile on the school laptops
Still compiling... :expressionless:
Lol
Nope it's not. I'm sorry. 
¿Pero comó?
Should be able to pass params to the builder. 
She's running it in the arduino ide, dunno how she can pass that without a console
-f override? 
It's going well. 
<@U1FAR4AJU> you could try passing the -f override. 
How's it been <@U1F0L9PEK> 
*gasp* silent for weeks then he returns
It doesn't look like a port issue.
