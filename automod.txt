cause it's a hassle
lemme figure out how to do it again
yeah lol
super spicy
you should re-build it
no, data is from about a month ago
eli did you re-build it with the new students stuff?.
Is that it? i.e. where the team meeting tomorrow is at the school to facilitate people being there.
!am markov 1983 students
The issue is that the selected representative is the direction we want our team i feel that the voices of our team now.
!am markov 1983 students
I can't learn from other students He's been like that some of the school right now there's an informal meeting in joshi's room at the museum for Thursday, so if your parents are driving you, ask if there is important is completely unfair and not okay.
!am markov 1983 students
lol
Anyone can join but we'll be planning the school When we are missing just a thought, but coach brought up a very valid point but I actually feel sick to my knowledge, someone confirm? because every meeting was called by two boys from the school.
!am markov 1983 students
"STUDNETS"
!am markov 1983 studnets
i really want it to say "survey"
<@U1F0GLE9M> Yeah I've had to redo a lot easier to track because in order to make it happen Well both Sorry preseason The point of build season, then comes the explanation of mentor support and the ramp.
!am markov 1983 design
Neither did I get mr. desilva'd I'm not seeing it.
!am markov 1983 programming
I'll ask you for any more teams that do stuff like this, I think I'll just wait in person, I might have missed something. so someone correct or send them back to the curve, the supports, and the best I can Skype now if you want more time from our mentors.
!am markov 1983 design
Probably also a group discussion about what you should have it lock in place to start tracking.
!am markov 1983 design
Nvm, we're going to the table and compromise.
!am markov 1983 students
I can’t make it so you started the CAD book, if you had.
!am markov 1983 all
I've been hearing that a bit later, but in an unbiased manner.
!am markov 1983 all
We need to say what you do Try the anti virus sees that it's short notice for the team, talk it out, do some team bonding, make us work together And what do you guys ready to deploy just in CAD, we can go into a meeting Sunday planned without knowledge of all the tools now so I don't really know how to search your name spot on that or no? yeah how about we just have to take the robot back inside and change all the pis could have data and documentation before June 1?
!am markov 1983 all
Why does the periodic function have something to the freshman or I had my laptop charger is in my life that I think that if everybody understood the situation that has any meaning.
!am markov 1983 all
By tuesday, I want to work on.
!am markov 1983 all
I think we might be able to just the global constants, but other than not allow the team without the dash yeah sure <@U1F1ETJM7> Can we turn this off I can for sure Practice field? oh k you can get into the robot to the rest of software team?
!am markov 1983 all

Also we're trying to get done by then, and I will be incomplete.

We thought that the voices of our team if we become 4H in the RBC as we would separate from the start and nobody there spoke against it I think we should think about keeping the meeting on Thursday at the musuem of flight So what mentor would want to stay on the PSA to get some insight into what they are constantly just giving 50% to each side.
!am markov 50509 students
I am working on that Yeah it is!
!am markov 50509 design

Why is Tucker mentioned in almost every design one lol
Almost done just needs pneumatics and talon placement Hey, so can we all don't work together That doesn't mean we can't all be thinking about smaller projects Tucker: I wanted to work fine I installed it in one install That's interesting.
!am markov 50509 design
^^^exactly Technically a different meeting will not ok, just making sure no it should be getting a house up here, we can trust that you'll all have more options True We're not done trying to do what feels best for the team is splitting into groups Sorry it's so formal, I pretty much it, then what I had done that, I'm extremely sorry I believe she removed thomas, it's that we wanted to ask them how their project is going, that's my two cents Do you mean to non-robotics members? maybe another student meeting to talk about things I don't see how that is exactly what they think will be as well That sounds like a swell idea...
!am markov 50509 students
Carpools are encouraged, so if your parents are driving you, ask if there was anything else we wanted our opinions would be able to talk about and I'd rather have us have time to make this decision got pushed off to a mentor to clean the water jet out, they should ask what matters right now nobody is trying to organize a meeting.
!am markov 50509 students
oh shit
Up to you without pissing off one side of the team then they said they wanted us to the rest of the adults there were a number of important takeaways from it.
!am markov 50509 students

"But we don't value their input, we don't value their input, and that the most important part of our team"
We will keep you posted as we would have gotten it sooner It�s not fair But we don't value their input, we don't value their input, and that the most important part of our team i feel that way And we can't come together in more than happy with the school administration retaining much of the school, but she does talk about the meeting being on such a short notice for the team, I think that any of us to share their opinions so as long as at least one response saying that is best for them.
!am markov 50509 students
Yeah I plan on at least 2 within 50 feet of you have questions about why coach had been removed, or what the truth is.... who do we have started to make hopper v2 and see you lurking here too.

If students wanted to work on files that are simply just trying to cooperate; I'm not saying I've been helping to setup a meeting at this point, nobody can ask here or through private messages Beyond that, just keep re-writing their code right, maybe it might already be made today But how do the trick.
!am markov 59033 all
One was on comp bot maybe Meet at school and robots, but they would have to put together a list right now there's an obvious split.
!am markov 59033 all

We are all in high hopes that this decision got pushed off to a webpage now when the administration feels to go side to side Just harder to maintain like its a different chanel Because I could speak freely and not give the whole design team is going to get the message to this channel. unit test server: <mailto:ubuntu@ec2-52-32-208-36.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com|ubuntu@ec2-52-32-208-36.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com> <@U1F0LEQ3W> pinned a message at the differences in wed's code vs. sat's code Erik is good for making dynamic models of forces and turn them into build seeaosn ok so how has the battery box from 2015 stacker bot?

They can fail pretty easily if put in extra hours I think that we're still with the possibility of hiring from outside the current school staff.

!am markov 1983 all
Thank you guys are doing with sophomores and have another student meeting and some time on Tuesday addressing concerns, but regardless we still need to determine how much it will be learning wpi Java from the viewpoints of Tipton being blindsided with the peg and gear drop so i still think itd be a bit odd compared to just the notes?
!am markov 1983 all
Why do you think they mainly care about the financial stuff, since he ran it all until this year <@U1F0QEL0Z> uploaded a file: <https://skunkworksteam1983.slack.com/files/U2A68KU8K/F76HSP885/image_uploaded_from_ios.jpg|Cheese me> and commented: putty packaged key for unit test machine using the RPis if we're prepping for build on the long run here guys *agreement with Eli - this conversation is not fair, as ailis mentioned, to hold a discussion about what you mean by which gear?
!am markov 1983 all
So far I have that's immediate is what was best for you, you will still see everyone else's opinions so that the mentors realized that she removed herself To be fair, you have your letters?
!am markov 1983 all
We discussed how we didn't finish yesterday? gonna be the same projects, know the results of each prototype, since some prototypes won't progress to the meeting but it is not helping or getting anywhere In my opinion, you get sleep deprivation and a half hours we had spares in the past I just saw th slack messages Yay!!!!!! thank you!!! Hey so I have 2 concerns.

I'll still post the pic of the chief objectives is to entirely to lose any sort of shadowing situation with the mentors that you�re speaking of but as soon as we would be a bit hazy in some sound engineering practices and you guys use.

Maybe light signals to alert the freshman about it, but I haven't used them before, so I think it's going on and they should know from that too.
!am markov 1983 all
We need our own team right now is longer than between now and forever shunned in my life but thank you I'll put the switch to the schools mascot though Do we have their own project they're working on the wrong port also when selecting autos we should let me know.
!am markov 100000 all
If they choose to continue working on it?
!am markov 1983 all
okay so a decision within in the extra time should probably have direct experience with the team, that still provides plenty of mentors and the parents.
!am markov 1983 all
I just wanna be sure I have 2 concerns.
!am markov 1983 all
With the limited amount of damage We have the IDE we're using. and you don't have the technology We have received at least they thought we did...
!am markov 1983 all
D: Eh it's going on you at school Should I skip over them and work out of the mock build would help drive team coming over at some point soon to discuss that with you right now, we are setting up a very brief meeting there were students at the museum for Thursday, so if you have anymore questions while I make this decision before Thursday.

There are far too many people, we may be starting the robotic arm project yeah.....

An agreement that will enable us to share their opinions so that we had for them which caught us very off guard. ill do my best friends, and there's no way that a family is being disassembled with such ease and we shouldn't try to force this to happen.

!automoderator markov 1983

LOL
They won't let us have time to figure out what the truth is.... who do we not spam this chat if that�s better for everyone else because you made a commitment to helping clean out the following survey.
!am markov 1983
We are missing just a few days ago, he wasn't trying to move towards that Just wanted to give names anyways at some point I feel like our first concern should be clarified.
!am markov 1983
Let's just say that the most about the students other than not allow the team is going, that's my two cents Do you have a plan to them for the freshmen, so unless Tipton does something, the freshmen aren't left completely behind We are doing a separation of two teams and now we have practice tomorrow yo if anyone needs a ride to the booster club meeting?
!am markov 1983
Which adults in particular Why do we have no way that there wouldn't be a good idea Okay.
!am markov 1983
It is also the bit about people going to translate into some of the team Just a heads up on that...
!am markov 1983
I can Can someone forward the email I wrote @channel The DeSilva's have graciously agreed to Well I have thats directly pertinent to our situation right now.
!am markov 1983
if people need rides, i know is that okay?
!am markov 1983
That means about 18 more people I will continue the tradition so many have worked so hard to build.
!am markov 1983
We don't know how to attach it here My bad I had done that, I'm extremely sorry I believe he has to take your opinion is ok.
!am markov 1983
I�m glad that <@U1F09HT4N> was able to come out of whatever this fiasco was, together and that's what matters right now and address that tomorrow I can oblige <!channel> right now there's an informal meeting in Gudor's after school on Tuesday specifically Yeah, you should also forward that email to Kenny?
!am markov 1983
In all fairness they have said it aint happening.
!am markov 1983

!am markov 1983

!am markov 1983
By having them there, we can drive the trucks get here If you don't like something we should start talking to the table to discuss what it may mean for the team.
!am markov 1983

!am markov 1983
These are starting to make too much sense
I can't go either, but we weren't on tuesday?
!am markov 1983
I have no i thought you were emailing gudor and wilson before emailing everyone else? or not as you choose.
!am markov 1983

!am markov 1000
Mostly parents I know that not all of us asked clarifying questions, but we should think about keeping the meeting tonight is cancelled?
!am markov 1000
I know we are setting up a very valid point but I would only ask that the students that have busier schedules or already have plans.
!automoderator markov 140
Who says we can't work together and stronger I don't think either side would exclude them Also, if the split but if we can attempt to be coach or assistant coach.

!am markov 100

!am markov 1000

!am markov 100
I don't think it switched hold on
Gear not being properly really hindered the hopper's performance Don't know if you noticed it, or maybe it was to make sure people knew what they want, and also we're talking very close but a little concerning, that is thru the mentors will probably be at different chapters in the final designing phase to assure reliability.
