i think its pretty obvious when a robot doesnt have a radio
we put a radio on 2016 and it drove for a while
and lol 2017 isn't plugged into the radio 
lol 2016 doesn't have a radio 
But I don’t think it’s software

Also 2016 bot is broken
okay I didn't do that

just wiped all the code from the roborio
what did it break? sorry I didn't mention it, I didn't know info night was tonight
woohoo
Very broken

did that break things? <@U1FAR4AJU>

<!channel> hey so Naba wants to leave
okay
as it defines the order that they're meant to be called it
because `Command.run()` is the only thing that should call them
so that they don't get called out of order by things that aren't `Command.run()`
okay, so protected so that they don't get called out of order by Command.run()?
so protected is the next best thing
ideally they would be private because they should only be called by `Command.run()`, but subclasses can't override private methods because they don't know they exist
but out of order != can be called
yes
<https://stackoverflow.com/questions/215497/in-java-difference-between-default-public-protected-and-private> is what I found, it looks like they can be called out of the subclass of command?
making them protected prevents them from being called out-of-order outside of subclasses of `Command`
those methods are parts of a strategy that are supposed to be called in a specific order, which is defined in `Command.run()`
no friends in java?? how lonely
commands use the strategy pattern <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy_pattern>
no friends in java
;)
because friends can only access your privates with protection
<@U1F0LEQ3W> Why protected init, exec, interrupt and end?
Gyro is functional. We will need a teacher (admin) to log onto the computers and install the navx mxp library, then move a file over, but it actually was pretty easy beyond that to get setup

I actually have to go for dinner. Read over <https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/concepts/class.html> (found pretty quick, but quality looks okay) and it should widen the realm of possibility a little bit on what classes can be

<@U1F1ETJM7> I can finish the Codeavademy Java lesson by tonight, but I don't understand some topics very well. Should I skip over them and go to the next one, or spend more time figuring it out? I can write some questions down to go over tomorrow.

Eh, you probably won't be able to fix the fact that you don't have jdk installed. There are java compilers online (<https://www.jdoodle.com/online-java-compiler> as an example) that you can probably navigate to use

If you guys go from programming to cheese and some fairly impressive puns during pre-season, what's going to happen during build season?
when we're setting people up with jdk I'll start checking 32 vs 64 bit. I'm guessing the difference (from a visual perspective only) would be installing in Program Files vs. x86?
Ah ok
I think the main issue was jdk 1.8 vs 1.9 vs jre vs exe
I’ll step back out and you may resume

<@U1F0LEQ3W> That's what it looks like.
the jdk 1.8.exe is the *installer* for jdk, so you'll need to get Ms Wilson or MC to enter credentials to install it.
JDK 1.8 is in a folder marked "FRC-SOFTWARE 2017"

I'm not sure what's up with the "bin" and "lib" but from that I don't think you have jdk 1.8 installed
lib
bin
jre1.8.0_131
There is:
Can you navigate to "C:\Program Files\Java" and list what's in there?
I'm not sure if I can give you a clear answer on that. I opened the "jdk-9_windows-x64_bin.exe", but all it did was ask me for admin credentials.
Are you sure the jdk is installed or is it just the installer
<@U7PBL4GTV> Yes, and we're struggling
<@U7PBR1J4B> Are you trying to set the jdk location to some folder
Ok
Ok, then we'll do it here
I can for sure help you tomorrow at some point but going to MC again probably won't help, unless you're missing software.
I don't count on McLaughlin to fix these kind of things; he's great at installing things but I wouldn't trust him to set up my dev environment fully

Here, how about we just fix this when we're at school? I can go to MC Glock, and see if he can fix this. If push comes to shove, I'll do it on ms word and get it reviewed by you guys.

<@U7PBR1J4B>
Can you post a screenshot of your "jkd1.8.0_&lt;something&gt;" directory, and confirm that the Java SDK is pointed to that?

it should have installed to C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_(whatever version) by default
I'll change the location, and see if it works
also <@U1F0W3FFC> we're using java 8
it should be in program files i think

what's in that folder?
the jdk folder is in your downloads?

Yup
?
is the folder unzipped

where is ur jdk located, just curious

Thats what it says
The selected directory is not a valid home for JDK
my jdk is @ C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-9
Keeps saying SDK doesn’t exist 
I'll try it a again and see
Yeah I’m having the same thing 
whatd it say?

hmm
I tried that one
called something like jdk-1.8 or something
nah it should be the folder with the jre

I'm literally doing classes on Java right now

just googled it, turns out java doesn't have classes or switch case 
<@U1F0W3FFC> you're in luck
At least they if/else
is there even switch case in java , seems like something only a high iq language would have 
you can join them
I think they may be starting the robotic arm project
yeah.....
Is it too late to join SciOli?
we switch/case on this team only.....
oh .... nobody told him??
<@U1F0QEL0Z> Just if/else(if) the hell outta that
then it crashes the fms!!!!!!!
someone's preseason project should be putting speakers on the robot with the turret voice tbh 
but what if there isn't a function on the other side that takes strings???????
now you're thinking with portals
if the fms sends a string with scores, why don't we just edit that string, make our score higher, and send it back????:thinking_face::thinking_face::thinking_face::thinking_face::thinking_face::thinking_face:

Oh, ok. The people in the airships needed that for free gears <@U1F0LEQ3W>
so like, if they wanted to add a gate as part of the field that was software controlled, this would be the way to check on its state
make the robot drive at 200% throttle if the opposing alliances score is higher :triumph::triumph:

<@U7PBR1J4B> there are already mechanisms for that, I think this is specifically for the state of the game rather than the state of the robot or the field
string separated by robot emojis :robot_face: 
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
If I'm getting this right, are there gonna be status updates from the robot to the drive team?
```&gt;json```
"power_up_dead_bot"
"Game Specific data string" is hella sketchy tho
depending on implementation
hey that's actually not bad
"Starting this year, WPILib, in all 3 languages, will have APIs to access a Game Specific data string which will contain information sent from the Field Management System to the Robot (via the Driver Station). There will also be a new text box in the Driver Station which will allow teams to simulate this functionality when testing at home. The implementation has been kept as generic as possible to allow for maximum flexibility as we use this new feature in future years."

<@U1F0QEL0Z> yes but that's already a thing, just give other robots hard enough love taps

that disables all the other teams robots

<@U1F0LEQ3W> I'm not sure where I should write out the code for the calculator project.
<@U7PBR1J4B> sorry, could you clarify the question?
I'm not even going to pretend I comprehend that rn 
<@U5MHBBXD0> I'll assume that functional means awake &amp; alert. Dude, I owe it all to R&amp;B and constant fluctuations on the position of my spine.

The last message was to <@U1F0LEQ3W>.
Yeah sorry.
pls
*bit coin*
U mean calculator?
think I'm missing something here
wait, wallet?
Hey programming, where do I create the wallet? I'm not sure what program was installed on my computer.
Heh it's all good
Interesting. I’ll take a peak when I’m next in. I dot. Want to distract the team with my crazy experiments 
Theyve locked us out of the first since forever, and the second as of this year
Unfortunately
That'd work if we could edit our environment var OR our local environment var
Basically you unpack it on system you have rights to and then push the JDK to a usb drive then copy it over. Yes it makes some things easier if you install the default way but there is nothing requiring it
Yes because Java doesn’t care where it is installed. It is a Windows convention that it get installed there. You just point your environment variable and IDE to wherever you installed it.
<@U7RLA5T62> can you do jdk w/o admin even if we don't have w access to /Programfiles/?
And you can ask one of the teachers for jdk
When you launch intellij it prompts for a password and i just used mine, worked fine
If anyone is curious, happy to walk you through all the steps when we have free time
JDK still requires admin for sanity.  It is possible to install JDK without admin rights but it requires some hoops to jump through
Also by the way for those in the future that were worried about needing admin rights, you can install IntelliJ without Admin rights.  <https://intellij-support.jetbrains.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/206899909-Is-it-possible-to-install-on-windows-as-standard-user>
Oh ok
Most likely won't *need* them.  The community edition provides 95% of what you would need.  There were some Thursday that didn't have the community edition but had the full edition and only had the 30 day trial.  I reached out to JetBrains and they offered us complimentary licenses if we wanted them to their entire product suite.  Not mandated but available if we want the full edition instead of community.
Why do we need licenses, like my intellij seems to work fine
Ok as the requestor, I am the one who needs to hand out IntelliJ licenses.  If you need/want a license, shoot me a note and I'll send you the link.
Cool.
Generally the community keys are twelve months but a piece of cake to renew. JetBrains likes to do this stuff.
Do those keys have an expiry?
For the ones that got trial that probably makes sense, yeah.
Should be able to just drop keys in and go
But I know there were a few that we think installed trial instead of community 
If its a redownload, we will need admin on the computers again which is a hassle, and I would be tentative unless there are significant advantages to ultimate &gt; community
Will we need to redownload the ultimate edition, or can we do a straight upgrade once it's downloaded?
Hey everyone. JetBrains approved free full licenses for IntelliJ for the team. I have 20. When I’m back home this evening, I will get the information out. I’ll need someone to be the keeper/distributor of the keys. 
<!channel> 
Hey all. With the limited amount of time left in pre-season, we gotta start setting some due dates to make sure that we can move forward as a team. By tuesday, I want everyone to have completed the Java Codecademy course. It's pretty short, and I know most of you have already done a good portion or a majority of it, so it shouldn't be too much work. If you get stuck, you can direct message Mr Vader, Thomas DeSilva or I with questions. After you finish the codecademy, the next step is to show off you object-oriented skills by making a Calculator class that will do math based on user input. If you guys get there, I'll post more specifics on what that should look like. Thanks and see you all at Girls Gen.
<@U7RLA5T62> has joined the group
We’ve been here for an hour and a half lmao
Ye Bella David and i
Oh rip
Now, in the plc
no
When is it
Are you presenting
wow
No
anyone going to the wpi presentation?
Yes
hek no
anyone in comp sci club? :evan_irl: 
Also, my apologies, earlier I said David Hadley was elected to the steering committee. It was instead Evan Frishholz
Questions/random talk can come here or through private messages
Beyond that, just keep working away at Codecademy. The basic steps for you to follow right now are finish the Java Codecademy course, then go through the Git "Hello World" tutorial. After that, we'll set you up with some more challening projects.
Between now and Thursday, keep trying to get to McLaughlin and get your development environments installed. We want to get this done as soon as possible so as many of you can get working on robot code before too long, which is a big step forward.
<!channel> Everybody should be in here now, please tell me ASAP if you see anybody that's missing. Slack is our main mode of communication, you're expected to be able to be contacted on it regularly. It's not as big of a deal pre-season, but during build season it can be critical to be able to get a hold of somebody at a moments notice. I forgot to mention this at the meeting tonight, but you should get slack on your phones as well and setup notifications, so that your presence here isn't solely linked to you being on your laptop.

I don't fully understand everything about what their talking about but this seems pretty devestating
<https://www.krackattacks.com/>
they've got their priorities straight on which things are more vulnerable than others
For example, HTTPS was previously bypassed in non-browser software, in Apple's iOS and OS X, in Android apps, in Android apps again, in banking apps, and *even in VPN apps*.

<https://stackoverflow.com/a/33066581/5217216> this is probably a good thing for people to read as java works the same way
yeah
I think that's the trick here
well, in this case the value that you're assigning is a reference
I had been taught that python was 100% pass by value
I know but I didn't think python didn't do any pass by reference
remember that with arrays, the variable stores a pointer to the first index, so you are indeed dealing with a reference
to be fairer in a non-copypasta kind of way, you'd get the same behavior if you did that in C/C++
*sigh*
To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Python. The language is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of it will go over a typical programmer's head. 
I'm trying to debug code and I have an array that's changing when I never change the value of it anywhere, so I think its gotta be something to do with this
```
abc = [1, 2, 3]
xyz = abc
abc[0] = 0
&gt;&gt;&gt;abc
[0, 2, 3]
&gt;&gt;&gt;xyz
[0, 2, 3]
xyz[0] = 1
&gt;&gt;&gt;abc
[1, 2, 3]
&gt;&gt;&gt;xyz
[1, 2, 3]
```
but arrays
```
a = 5
b = a
a = 2
&gt;&gt;&gt;b
5
```
most of the times when you set one variable equal to another, you're setting a copy
python is a terrifying language
did you delete a message nathan or is slack being buggy

I'll hold on making the vision repo public until I get Erik's approval
there's no reason to keep it private, share our mistakes so other's won't make them
oh well
which doesn't make sense

It means that we can reuse this code for 201
Do people really need to know that we had 3 master branches?
Wait I thought of a reason to keep it private
visionrecognition too?
Public.

If they were smart they would have found a way to not be freshmen
are there any smart fresh people?
lets get them to learn labview
What
uhh
oops
leader of fresh people bella bella bella mike
Have them learn 2017 or slippery which eases them into build seeaosn 
ok so who is gonna be the fresh prince of fresh people
i agree with tucker
We'll let them teach themselves to program while we make the chairmans video
I think your idea works
?
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nCqRmx3Dnw>
wait so have we figured out what we're doing with the freshpeople?
Let's all join satellite
let's all become logistic leads
I feel personally targeted 
Let's just all go to chairmans
Ha jokes on you me and Nathan are switching places
Ree get out design normie

Let's round it to a yes
Shame it's such a close call

We should make a 4H computer science team
lmao who would ever want to learn how to program
Make it robotics programming club
Should we join or nahhhh

There are 6 people here, only 2 of us that aren't leading the meeting know code, and it's just incredibly awkward and not so hot
Rip I was gonna go what’s going on
dear lord the comp sci club that is being started at our school is no bueno
Official list of what you'll be getting if you go down to MC
Software
IntelliJ - Java IDE that will allow us to write code
FRC IntelliJ plugin - Software written for IntelliJ to provide more robust tools specifically for development with Java in an FRC context
JDK 1.8 - Java Development Kit, requried to compile any kind of java program.
FRC Update Suite - Various software and backend libraries to allow us to run other required software (Driverstation, SmartDashboard, etc)
CTRLib - A library that we will need downloaded and put into the WPILib user folder (downloaded and installed through the FRC Update Suite)
Git - Version control software that allows for the team to manage multi person development of the code base.
I didn't get an email but Joshi might be confirming directly.
Alright it's been two minutes are we good
nice
Once he sends the email
Literally in about 2 minutes
so whens the earliest we can get stuff on our computers
oh
He didn't understand he needed to confirm, so he's sending an email to mclaughlin right now
I'll check
did the program list get approved by joshi/mclaughlin
Sure, that's one idea
but if they have their own project they're working on for slippery/2017 they can pick up some skills without worrying about anyone undoing
none of the freshmen are going to learn anything if we just keep re-writing their code
right, maybe it might be better if that's what they do year round 
It's totally doable preseason
We won't have things for them to do
I'm just concerned about build season
they get experience with a legit robot and we dont have to worry about stepping on them
sounds kinda bad but maybe we should just let the freshpeople work on a previous years robot
*dab*

1983 and 7005

no problem.
And WPILib is part of the FRC Update Suite
kind of busy right now though
it's not
Going through and listing software to install, step 5 is not needed for mclaughlin right?

I have the opportunity to put together a list right now
<@U1F0LEQ3W> Where is the Java setup guide?
Joshi*
Okay, then if nothing changes before tomorrow I'll present the list to JOshi
<@U1F1ETJM7> we need to get that list approved as soon as we can do that we make sure we can get everything downloaded before approval becomes a lot more complicated 
I think the list is the stuff on the java setup guide, the FRC update suite, and git, but I might be forgetting something
I've talked to him about it, just need the list
Joshi is going to sign off on the list
so joshi is the one signing off on the list or is that someone else
Mr Vader was going to test Thomas's list before I confirmed with joshi and got it to McLaughlin
so what's the situation with the program list for mclaughlin?
^ yee
That module can then be actually built for programmers to play with 
:ok_hand:
Payton can incorporate it into his new drive base design for the mock build season
wowowowowowowow
Lol
WOAHAHAAHHA
(shes right next to me rn)
but it will be in cad
I just talked to Izzie about preseason projects and suggested it
we aren't going to build a robot
the | is on the right side, the -- is on the left
design team is going through a whole mock build season, If you guys want to talk with us while we are doing that we can integrate sensors and things like that into the design
and lots of math
right; they had one | and one --
and you need to have a way of dealing with rotation, so you either need two or to not care about rotation and put it dead center
well, and a place to mount it to
on a suspension
We shouldn't need an extra motor port; just an axle with an encoder
yeah
Then it's just incorporated during build season as an "x by y by z" volume slot on the drivebase
Naively it should be a preseason design project
I mean
we've talked about doing that but never had the space/time
they're on a suspension so they should stay engaged all the time
they have 2 sets of omnis that are just for encoding

There definitely will be a new survey
within the students there was some confusion about what the survey that generated the pie chart seen above was for (interim coach vs. permanent coach) so there may be a reassess.
None of those four will be as fair as I know.
<@U1F0LEEE9> <@U1F0LEQ3W> <@U2KD3E39A> The general consensus within the team at this points seems to be to stay with the school. Today we found out that Wilson, Gudor, Joshi, and Ms. Jones will be "interim" coaches. They will switch off, and meetings (starting next week) will run from 6-8 (they don't want to work incredibly long days). Tipton has said that within 30 days from now she'd like for us to have a permanent coach.
It's fine
It merely needs convincing
Now that you've kicked it

just asked joshi, he'll do it for us
r i p
just talked to mclaughlin, he says we needs a teacher to write up a list of all the programs we need
by the way: the school laptops now have locked access to the environment variable panel, so we cannot add even to our user path without administrator intervention.
but yeah, feel free to ask if you're not sure if something I'm saying just seems objective to me because of my experiences or if I have actual evidence
which is what's making a lot of this hard and why you guys feel left out of the loop, because it's really hard to draw that line right now
and in general my goal is to be honest at all times and as open as possible, but there are occasionally things that mentors aren't supposed to talk to students about because it wouldn't be professional
I agree
I'm not saying that opinions shouldn't have a voice, but I think we need to know what we know versus what we've drawn conclusions about, because if what we've been told is blatantly not true then we can process that differently as the disproval of an opinion
We can't get both sides of the story if one side is lying, so we have to trust our mentors and parents to be as objective as possible
to me, my own experience is objective, but to anyone else it isn't
so that's why it may seem like I'm not being objective about things
a lot of the complaints are about things that you can't objectively quantify, like motives, or what's "good" for the team
the problem is that a lot of these things aren't being recorded, and legally can't be unless everyone involved consents (but even asking is a good way to seem hostile off the bat), so there isn't a way to truly objectively say anything about any of this
my point is we want to be objective and we just don't have enough information to do that successfully right now, which is why we wanted to go to listen to learn.
but anyway
I think most of the seniors were there and afterward they told me that she didn't
don't remember as much because of it I guess.
Oh, I was in the car listening in on the meeting
then a parent meeting after
there was a student meeting right after school when coach got suspended
I don't remember that, was it a parent meeting or student meeting?
but otherwise I think that's fair
and there were students at the parent meeting who can confirm what she said, although they were seniors
I mean I'd say that last one should be pretty solid from your point of view, I think you were at the meeting she told us she apologized at
the issue I guess right now is that the viewpoints of Tipton from the students are very different from the viewpoints of Tipton that the mentors/parents have. We haven't had/taken the opportunity to reach out to her and try to communicate and compromise, and we haven't been told of the times that she has lied (and we don't have any proof), so we cannot logically draw any conclusions without others' opinions. We want to be as professional as possible and consider the options and the evidence we have, but we feel like we don't have any evidence of what's happened in the past and information on possibilities for the future (4H versus school).
e.g. the time she told all the parents that she apologized to all the students for not being more involved at the end of last year
she's demonstrated a willingness to be dishonest to look like the good guy before
I'm not willing to give her the benefit of the doubt anymore, really
Maybe she hadn't said that she had contacted you already. It's possible she just said that she planned on reaching out to you.
am
between 9-10
I got her email at 3:23 PM, when did you talk to him?
Gudor came back and said that she had already tried to contact you by the time Gudor and her talked
if he did it in an unprofessional way
she wasn't going to until gudor talked to her
It doesn't make sense that she fired coach for sticking up for you then tried to bring you back...
I don't think there's any other reasonable explanation given the timing honestly
I'm trying to keep straight in my head what has been directly told to us versus correlations we've made
keep in mind that's not something that anyone is going to admit, but the trend matches
What do you mean by "The truth"?
he sent a long and pretty reasonable email to tipton and scott logan on sunday afternoon (they noted in their email removing me that any questions should go to them) and on monday afternoon he was fired
ok really gotta go now bye
so messed up
the truth is that the last straw there was that he stuck up for me when I got removed
ok
Which I think was technically staff
He was still on payroll as coach
he was fired as coach though
he was never fired from staff, he retired
So then can we say that business with coach with re: audit == business with coach re: firing from staff position?
gotta run now
it was specifically in regard to his suspension
was that specifically in regards to the audit last year though? That seemed like SOP in hindsight if they were truly concerned about fraud
That was the official word during the investigation last year
What do you mean it's always been said is what I meant to ask
Clearly this is just personal conflict, that's not a good enough reason
Ref to Tim's observation.
<@U2KD3E39A> What do you mean by your last statement?
there was a difference in the two bans
I think that required an outside voice to convince her that it wasn't a good idea though
And it's always been said that the business with coach was never about student safety
Well, if she's willing to walk back the ban on you (Thomas) there's at least faint hope of walking back the ban on coach too.
I don't think it leaves any room for interpretation unless you count a complete reversal
I don't know
well the wording of the email is kind of absolute
There's a difference between a temporary "don't come on campus" and whether he'll be welcome back as a mentor; I get that they can easily go hand in hand but there could have been concern from administration about Steele's direct and immediate involvement in what is going on
there were five demonstrably false things that she said last night, but we can discuss those another time
I do think it's important to note that she did know the answer to the question of whether coach would be allowed back as a mentor even though she said she would find out, though
I suspect principals have a lot of leeway in the name of ensuring student safety.  Over the long term, due process may come into play.
then the next question is if its SOP to do that, but I don't think we can answer that on our own
just as they'd be in their rights to ban me or anyone else
yes
So they were (objectively) within their rights to do that?
yes
from a purely objective stand point, I would want to know what allows them to lay that claim. Could they do that to anybody that is not staff at the school?
it also unambiguously says "you are not welcomed to participate in any activity at the school"
forwarded to eli
I also have an email from district HR to coach that proves it
Yeah - when has there ever been security for a parent meeting?
interesting.
I wasn't one 
Ask any parent that chatted with the guard.
<@U2KD3E39A> Do you know that for sure? That speculation has been made but I haven't heard it confirmed
Ok.  I will take my cues from the students.  You all are why I show up.
It's a fact right now that we're still with the school, a vote has not been called. Doesn't mean some don't want to
There was actually a security guard posted to ensure that coach did not attend. Much weirdness.
That's from the student population; it sounds like the parents might have different ideas
For now it sounds like we're sticking with the school, a vote has not yet been called
i've since heard that coach was uninvited from the meeting ("don't come")
Thanks for the update.  So neither option was selected?
that was mostly stream of thought from last night so its not super coherent
The situation was that coach was removed from the team by decree of Tipton. At the parent meeting tonight, it became unclear exactly who made the final call, as she was not allowed to answer (she did this many times where she said she couldn't answer. We don't know the exact reason but we have to assume its legitimate). Many students met after school on property that Erin's dad had access to. We mostly discussed what we wanted to do at the parent meeting, and in the 2 and a half hours we had we decided that we wanted to sit and listen to everybody's point of view, and if we were going to ask questions they would be either personal questions, or questions agreed upon by the group so that it was clear that each student spoke for themselves. We did not have enough time to discuss questions we wanted to ask as a group, which was a mistake, as we were asked many times questions that we had for them which caught us very off guard. 
The meeting started at 7 in the BPC, where many parents, many students, many mentors, and Ross (who doesn't really fit into those categories) came. The PTSA board was there, Connie was there, the DeSilvas were there, but Coach did not come (I do not know if he was invited or not.) Tipton would not answer questions about why coach had been removed, or what the interaction was between her and Thomas DeSilva. We learned about two possible options for the team. One was staying with the school, and losing coach definitaly as a paid position, but we don't even know if he will be welcomed back as a mentor for the team as a mentor. Tipton said she would have an answer soon about that. The other option is to become a 4H team, which means that we would separate from the school. This would almost guarantee that we would lose access to the shop in the immediate sense, but there is a chance that we would be able to work on school property in the future. This option has not been researched much yet (and if it has, the results of said research were not shared with the group). We don't know if we would get the money that we have with PTSA if we split from the team, so that would have to be considered as well. As of right now, we are staying with the team, and we do not have an interim coach announced yet before we go through the hiring process.
For the hiring process, Tipton promised that students (note the plural) would have a seat on the hiring team. From what Tipton said, she made it sound like it would most likely be Gudor, Wilson, Ms. Jones (previous FTC coach) or Bowlin. She also mentioned the possibility of hiring from outside the current school staff. The other main point that was discussed is that there needs to be a Robotics ASB formed to manage the flow of money through the PTSA to the team. As of now (as far as I know) no decision has been finalized about how the ASB will be selected, and whether they will be elected by the students or not.
Also we're trying to keep most of this information within the team right now.
I wrote it after coming home last night
Source?
Ok
Get ready for some copy pasting and a wall of text
What happened at the parent meeting last night?
just trying to get a gauge from lots of different perspectives
how's everyone here feeling?
it's a little nebulous right now and really depends on how the 4H proposal ends up going
I get we would lose the shop
I don't know if you know about specifics but the one questions I have that's immediate is what stuff are we allowed to keep.
indeed
Strange days 
the tl;dr is 4H and then tipton doesn't have the authority to choose mentors, but the parents need to agree on it
which, as andy said, is very important for everyone's parents to be at
hinges on the parent meeting tomorrow
how long before we hear about it?
before everyone panics: there is a plan

which is another reason I'd prefer to use java, I think you'll all get a lot more mileage out of it
then they open sourced it
kotlin was made by JetBrains for mostly internal use I think
yeah, I mean I've heard of kotlin, mostly because intellij comes with plugins for it by default, but I've never actually seen it used anywhere
lol. I was mostly mentioning the Kotlin thing because of curiosity, hadn't heard of it before and was wondering if you had. If you haven't we probably shouldn't make a double leap this season
it's probably that
but maybe I'm just salty that a kid on the internet offended my delicate sensibilities ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
that's fair.
it's less that and more that he has more confidence in his opinions than he probably should given his background
in an ideal world his opinions on mentoring wouldn't affect his opinions on good programming language but I'll keep that in mind
yeah, I'd just take what he has to say with a grain of salt
that's an interesting view to say the least
he's definitely got some opinions
<https://www.reddit.com/r/FRC/comments/6ozxez/mentors/dklkmdo/> this thread
how so?
dude rustles my jimmies
ah
he is the team lead, was programming lead last year
this wouldn't happen to be their programming/team lead would it
java lambdas are easy enough imo, if we want singletons with a single keyword we can bring in dependency injection
The only other thing he's mentioned that caught my interest is golang-esque multithreading
there are other things he's talking about that they do too, it does sound cool but I don't know how much more useful it will be
and intellij has enough code generation built in that the standard java boilerplate isn't really that painful
that was the one I brought up, yeah
cons would be I don't think any of us know kotlin
"only real con imo is that there aren't as many resources out there for it, but we've not had that problem"
"so for pros, 100% java interop (but that's a bare minimum), it's much more concise and faster to write, there's a ton of boilerplate reduction (full object composition isn't even an extra line of code, single keyword singletons, function assignment, ezpz lambdas), it's' null safe meaning no null pointer exceptions unless you specifically allow them"
this is what he said:

**No it won’t
OK. We’ve been trying to keep this quiet.* But at 8 PM Eastern Time today, we’ll be releasing the teaser for the upcoming season.

FIRST Robotics Competition Twitter Feed
FIRST Robotics Competition Facebook Page
The teaser will be released simultaneously, or at least within a few seconds of each other, on all these links. Though only one, and I’m not saying which, will be showing the special extended ‘Director’s Cut.'**

Tablets and cameras were found
I have been told it will return to 6-9 for build season
yeah. I'm frustrated cause I know it will put a strain on the mentors but it's a decision from above that has already been worked back from 3:30
Ouch.  I will be there as soon as I can
<!channel> just a heads up to everyone; during preaseason robotics will start at 5 and end at 7:30.
:ok_hand:
Yeah I just checked with Bowlin too. 
If anybody was going to the shop organization thing, Bowlin hasn't heard back from coach so it's probably not happening
.-.
*squints at eli*
I'm sure they'll be fine until someone spills mountain dew on them
Rip business team 
pretty sure
Is that the biz room?
though coach said weeks but maybe something's changed
Olsens?
The last I heard about it the new Intro to Robotics teacher is going to use that room, but I never heard confirmation about that
think we'll probably be in ms. weeks's room
Bowlin said something about moving us
Do we have the programming lair this year 
who did their summer homework 
I'm going
doesn't mean we shouldn't help
I've actually tried out just about all the tools now so I have a clearer picture of what the options are
Shop != programming lair
yeah, Mr Bowlin mentioned a shop cleanup thing this thursday tho
the 12th
yeah we never really resolved java vs c++
First meeting is Tuesday right

we'll discuss this in detail in a more neutral forum

10/10 would work :ok_hand:

haha joke, java sucks
lets keep our values in a .java file
._. my bad
<@U1FAR4AJU> we did in 2016 though
Dude it was joke
<@U1FAR4AJU> most of our PIDs last year iirc were hard coded values either in the command or in Robot.h
and figure out what we can improve and what we can get rid of
one of the first things we should do is an architecture review of last year's code where we analyze the design decisions we made
I thought we were keeping it in a text file 
keep that in mind
huh. we should do that more then, dunno how well it would work for multiple people trying to work on different things but I think we could pull it off better
no
Is there a reason that didn't work well?
yes
<@U1F0LEQ3W> Have we tried storing PID values in text files before so that thye don't have to be recompiled?

How can I program this


unlikely
Are the google product forums more than just a graveyard?
nope. same deal
I'm trying chrome canary for the hell of it.
The only thing I don't know how to decipher is things listed as "Section" instead of "File"
Everything has full read access that it's trying to get to
Discussion of NTFS in my operating systems class was basically limited to "this exists, I hope you never have to deal with it"
I'm not entirely sure how file handles work in windows so this might be pointless though ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Alright
and their containing directories
go through the file handles it owns and check that the user that's running chrome has access to them
(I'm looking at the list that chrome.exe is open on)
How would handle tell me that it can't open a specific file?
although in that case you might find an info or warn event about it around the same time as the hang error
you might try using handle to see if it's stuck trying to open a file that it can't get to <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/handle>
so whatever is going wrong is probably a chrome problem then
never mind, reinstalling did nothing. same deal
reinstalling now. My dad says he's tried it before and it might work for a day then crash again. The only logs in event viewer are "Error" under id "Application Hang"
if reinstalling doesn't work, check event viewer for errors the next time it freezes
<https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!msg/chrome/40fxuq_vhjk/Z_7yhDUhAgAJ> seems possibly relevant
can't uninstall until all running instances are close :&lt; I'll just wait I guess
I'll do that real quick
yeah
Chrome?
did you already try reinstalling
maybe
may have been related to a permissions issue on the profile
Access is denied to killing even when running as admin?
I had that once but I don't remember how I fixed it
Download Process Explorer from Microsoft for a better look at what's going on
That's about the extent of my troubleshooting knowledge, good luck
Which makes me think it's a hardware issue, but only affecting chrome?
the really weird part is that the same issue existed on my dad's non functional previous all in one, the one he has now is a direct replacement

this is a gradle plugin that manages dependencies and generates a cmake file to handle the actual build
wait hold on, grade is java only right?
/figure out how boost testing works
the cmake configuration it generates doesn't include anything for unit testing though, so I'll probably need to figure out how 5499's project works with boost and stick them together
:cool:
yes
sick, but can u use it from command line

so did you just write a script to execute the wpilib deploy thing or is it more complicated than that?
oh ok
nathan go home
said no one ever 
but i like eclipse :-(
tucker go home
But the eclipse is on the 22nd, you have to use it until then
Fuck yeah
got code deployed with clion, confirmed not using eclipse next year
yeah I'll look for that
Like I said I'm pretty sure I have everything downloaded and installed. I don't think I have the build setting setup correctly, whenever I try to build I just get "make: *** No targets specified and no makefile found.  Stop."
should be a "toolchains" menu under preferences or project setup or something that needs to be pointed at your minGW installation
are you talking about the wpilib stuff?
help-&gt;install new software?
But I don't have eclipse configured correctly
I have everything downloaded and installed
<https://github.com/Skunkworks1983/Loading-Bar-Package>
I completely forget how to get eclipse setup to build with the toolchain
o
going to a synthesis event
making sure I have a build environment for our code by tomorrow morning
why eclipse though
Have you tried plugging the toaster in?
this is so great... trying to install the newest eclipse on a laptop, realized I needed jre on the first run of the installer. It managed to set some global flag that I don't have jre and just routes to a webpage now when I run the installer again.

You are going to cook a lion on a gradle?
eventually I'll get around to trying out CLion with gradle but my todo list is large and daunting
I'll look through it more tmr but Java looks way cleaner to be honest
Interesting. 
yeah
Was it legacy even in c++ then (just following previous years)?
robots are made up of subsystems, so `Robot` contains `Subsystem`s
`CommandBase` isn't really a reasonable place to put pointers to all of the subsystems because it's the base class for `Command`s
Finally getting around to looking at the java project a little bit. What's the reasoning behind consolidating CommandBase into Robot?
Wow
Whoa there
<@U1F0W3FFC> uploaded a file: <https://skunkworksteam1983.slack.com/files/U1F0W3FFC/F6BRRJTR7/image_uploaded_from_ios.jpg|hi thomas>
my charger is in my living room with the biscuit
ok
nope, just grabbed it today
oh, so you probably didn't have it 8 days ago then
it was at Ailis's house
bringing it to challenge air tomorrow
wait why do you have the go bag
The other one is in one of the lego robotics workshop laptop's bag
One programming laptop charger is in the go bag with me
k
Nah we're good
would be about half an hour
I could bring my charger down there if it's needed
Downloading driver station on a counselors laptip
Yee
is there a demo?
We have 16% on programming laptop and no charger 
Rip us
I think I have the one for mine
for my laptop?
Eyyyy <@U1F0LEQ3W> where's the charger for your laptop in the cabinet 
 ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
oops
oh, guess I only told coach
Nah Bowlin just noticed it was missing 
I'm out of town
do you need it for something?
:ok_hand:
it's in my living room
<!channel> it's gone 
What happened to slippery biscuit 
you can see what I mean in `UT_TankDrive`: if `Robot` had a `public static Drivebase`, then `TankDrive` wouldn't need to take one in its constructor, meaning there wouldn't be any way to pass that mocked `Drivebase` in for the unit tests
you can't mock member variables, so it's good practice to hide them and use getters instead in case you need to mock something for a test
testability
why the private subsystems?
it just works
no interfaces to maintain, no janky macros, no running on test servers
yeah. I think that's one of the biggest advantages
unit testing looks dope tho
although you did remind me that I forgot to add inner classes for the different varieties of constants
prevents spaghetti
no free-range variables or functions
gross
anything at the top-level global scope has to be a class
oh, that's a java thing
having robotmap be its own class seems a bit odd compared to just the global constants, but other than that looks pretty much the same as c++
the architecture choices I made were pretty deliberate, do you have questions about it?
looks neat, not sure about some of the architecture of the code but its whatever
I think you need to maximise a single roborio, so if need be, your rio can take on extra processing from the other robots on your alliance so everyone can get a +7% speed bonus
so the commands you're running don't really have an impact on the threadedness of the program unless you're doing the threading explicitly
Yeah
realistically though the scheduler is single threaded anyway and the network communication talking to the FMS/driver station has its own thread
would need to look into how the deployment script calls the JVM
technically maybe
Robo Rio de lágrimas
So could you in theory make the VM only have a single virtual processor on one of the real time processors on the roborio and use the other one for running vision, because if you are only executing one command you don't need two processors, right?
if I was running more than just one long-running command I would need to tell the scheduler to cancel anything that's running in the init methods, but I wasn't, so I was lazy
Or does the periodic function have something to do with that?
Why don't you have to disable auto or Tele? Does the schedular switch them on it's own based off the driver station?
(if you installed intellij you should be able to import the project straight from github and at least run my unit tests)
take a look at the source code and let me know what you think compared to C++ <https://github.com/trdesilva/JavaBiscuit>
:clap:
tools seem easy enough to use, although I did encounter a small bug on project setup
I got slippery biscuit running on java and I don't think it was too hard

No we are outside
Cause there are 3 ambulances outside and more people
Um so we're inside?
we're out back with trailer 
What?
never mind, we're in back 
look out ur window 
We're here, but nobody else is
who's coming to the field today?
sounds good. I'll probably be there around 10:45
May be a bit later, but we will be heading over there from the school very soon.
10:30
Is the practice field available yet or eta?
I put the laptops and the charger back in the programming drawer of the red tool chest
That'd be great, thanks. The chargers are probably with they laptops
I'll pick them up when we run by the school
should still be at school
Did anybody bring the 2 DS laptops home or are they still at school?
Looked, can't find it
Is anyone still there I think I left my charger
Heck
No. 
do we have arrangements with mclaughlin to keep our laptops ?
Thanks
As far as I know we're meeting first at school
Should I head to the school or directly to the practice field?
Take home the cardboard boiler target plz, and the fake gear lift setup with vision target, so we are sure to have them for summer. We can remount them on something portable.
Sounds good. 
Also, I know you guys already did this, but I'd like to do a round of post-mortem one-on-ones with everyone Thursday
Andy says we can get into the practice field, so those who are familiar should spend the last few meetings on vision

He redeployed over it and somehow it worked 
What was the issue?
fixed 
I don't have time to figure this out right now though
so it is right about no code running
Oh
the first one should be there if C++ code is running, the second should if Java is
?
So deploying isn't working correctly
I can't find either 
Was it my fault?
Which or both?
I bet its all three of those things
Yee
One of those two things?
Eyyy guess what's missing 
Oki doki
If not check if there's a file at /var/run/natinst/FRC_UserProgram.pid
SSH into the Rio and check if FRCUserProgram is running with `ps ax`
Java didn't take that long to install try running the 2017 update suite on it
K
I don't want to mess with anything Eriks doing 
Have you tried preasing the reset button on the Rio?
Ok so slippery is out of commission until you can fix it or is there something I can do <@U1F0WAUUS> 
Eclipse says I have a successful deploy but driver station says there's no robot code
Wait is your issue deploying or running the code? Because I could deploy I just couldn't get it to take the java
Needs a full 2017 update maybe?
I tried to put Java on it and it didn't wasn't running
Erikkkkkk
Oh I definitely broke it
Has anyone else had problems deploying to slippery recently

Hi Izzie - it's great to see enhanced communication between the subteams. Please scroll up for some thoughts on the swervebot design from a software (software mentor, anyway, with heartless disregard for the joys of Totebot) point of view.
Welcome
hi
DUN DUUUN DUN DUUUUUUUUUN DA DA DA DA DA DAAA DA DAAAA DUN DUN DA DA DA DA DA 
Welcome to Jurassic park
<@U5BS3Q282> has joined the group
<@U1F0P4FA5> has joined the group
Adding Izzie and Franco to help with communication between sub teams.
The more I think about it, the more I think ToteBot2/SwerveBot needs to be housed in some kind of a cage, maybe 1/2" mesh, onto which we can readily attach sensors and modules and easily run wires through. Any side (or top) of should be readily removable to be worked on separately, but rigidly held in place when attached.  A tiny smooth sided unibody case just doesn't make sense for prototyping and development. It's not as amusing but way more useful.
For those interested in vision, I'm really enjoying this guy's posts: <http://www.pyimagesearch.com/>

Only when you crap it up - seriously
And you guys wanted to kick me out of the slack
I do like this design + code integration tho, keep that up for sure
There is probably going to be a meeting about what is going to happen on Tuesday
Crazy talk sorry
Are you sure we could sit down? That's entirely new territory
We only have stand ups though 
Coordinate efforts
?
Time for a sitdown, sounds like
Whoever wants to
Probably
and are you going to be working with thomas on that or no?
super skunk?
Im actually designing a tank drive right now for super skunk, but as soon as im done with it ill work on getting a swerve drive design done and hopefully made. 
Mentors are hoping to rescue the practice field pieces btw - store until we find a home for it
But I see what you're saying.
Probably not going to be put to the test of an actual competition field
Less stuff to break is all I'm thinking
depends on which motor would be that + how much space we have inside of a tote (not much)
But 1 z motor vs 4 - just sayin
Thomas is keen to start on that I know
(tote bot 2.0)
Really depends on the game. This year 16 pulled it off pretty well so that's just something to keep in mind on top of everything else. However I believe they're are plans on an off season swerve drive project so that document is a good start for the math behind the code base
As opposed to all slaved together I mean
 Seems like the question is whether or not the "snake turn" capability is worth the extra logical and physical complexity of 4 independent z axes
Idk it is something that I used two years ago when I was programming my FTC bot, I had a lot of help though, but it can be done.
Excuse u
you can just *do it*
no reasoning
it's all real
well now it's on paper and you don't have to use logic
I've tried to logic that through before...I get weird looks at Ikea when I'm staring at the wheels off a spinning cart

Also, Tipton was listing important parts of the team, and she said 'programming, electrical, and software' which I feel puts a lot of pressure on us

also you've been developing C++ code in a Java environment all year anyway
But I love IntelliJ and ReSharper (for C#)
Dunno if CLion does cross compilation or not
License is for full version all products including CLion
which I haven't tried, but is for C++
they also make CLion
so excited to develop c++ code in a java editor!! woohoo

No idea if it works or not but the WPILib guy at Houston said it does
And then you'll want this FRC plugin <https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/9405-frc>
We've talked about switching from C++ to Java so I've set us up with free IntelliJ licenses (actually, the whole JetBrains tool suite) - email me at <mailto:brianstephenspratt@gmail.com|brianstephenspratt@gmail.com> and I'll hook you up with the license server.

can't tell if "very selective and they're all geniuses" is a compliment or insult...

Why do you eat everything 
:clap:
we ate them
:raised_hands::clap:
I left some of those horrible pink lucky sticks at the field for you
Okay cool
The plan was to start practicing at 6
Back to working on autos. If drive team is up for it we'll be ready in about 1-1.5 hrs
More like 4/10 but still
Ok not that much actually
5 minutes to an actual value
that's pretty good
&gt;2/3rds accuracy
Ok
I just started tuning the flywheel (autos took priority) so I'm still unsure
From what I was hearing yesterday it seemed like we didn't have time for practice 
Don't know. They're still working on the hopper back at school, latest they get back is 3:30 but there's stuff to do after that so I don't know. 
How much time do you guys need
I kind of left it up to them but I don't think anyone came to a decision
<@U1F0LEQ3W> is drive team coming over at some point today or no?
yeah
how about support for other IDE's

ok cool
Getting 1 chicken 3 asada and 1 lengua
Its food
lol thats all good
Just a heads up the taco truck is probably not going to get that specific but we'll try
Me: beef beans cheese rice guac lime cilantro
Nathan: whatever tucker got
Tucker: steak beans cheese sour cream guacamole
Joseph: rice beans chicken salsa cilantro cheese
In southpark
A taco truck
Where are you getting them?
O
joseph
Also who is jo
Yeah I think we have enough cash
everyone inc. tucker/jo/bowlin?
be astronauts
peanut butter
What burritos does everyone want?
I only have a debit card, can't pay you back directly
...?
If you got the dough we got the tubes
Should I ask the others?
Jo Tucker Bowlin Nathan and I 
Is it just you two?
100000000
How many\what flavor
Burritos would be hella
 Like Mountain Dew lucky sticks burritos?
You want us to bring anything?
Cool cool
We're on our way
Nathan and i are at the practice field, anybody else going to show up?

how do you not have a second period though
ok probably just going to wait for someone who knows what they're doing come 
which means finding one of those too
you'd also need to solder them onto the connector at the talon end
where might the wires for the shooter encoder be

ok 
noooo 
Not now...
can you ask him if he can come down to the shop and wire this encoder 
Don't text in class Mike

Tough end, but well played.  The code showed well, particularly given the limited time and other obstacles.  Nice job, programmers.
MEMEBALLS FTW
:-/
shooter motors are catching so the turret gets caught 
Hope we tweak that shooter tho
Good job! Clutch last gear
:paella: ftw
this gon b good
Gee whiz! That was fun. Good playing!
I'm wrestling with some insecurity issues in my life but thank you all for playing with me.
Well played. I salute you all.
yuuup gonna be hype

Are potentially a 3 gear auto alliance ?
Jeez
Just battery loss
Did we learn anything about that power loss from the logs?
Good luck this afternoon!
Good day overall though!

Looking now at kids
Did we restart robot code in that last match?
<@U1F0W3FFC> <@U1F1ETJM7> drive team is taking a lunch break after this match, figure out why we're wiggling unnecessarily

In the YouTube app this works for me: <https://youtu.be/rboWrrLRlKA>
Is the stream working for anyone else? It's not for me
We should have an auto that shoots flaming memeballs 
Those dang meteor springs
Nah man I think it's just the springs :/
Meteor caught the airship on fire causing an auxiliary chemical reaction on another robot
ITS LIT

Always wiggles?  Need video!
But that's ok because the wait is long enough
Also for some reason the switch isn't reading, so it does it every time

I like the sound of "hasn't missed yet"!
I'm a competent programmerrrrr
Other than the time the things were in the wrong order
The auto hasn't missed yet so we haven't really verified it, but it looks like it should work
Well done!

thx
there it is
:blank:
i have some important information
hey guys
Sounds proper
I cleaned the project and rebuilt, they came back, but git didn't find them so I think we're good
If project is well configured those .o files will be gone after a Clean
I think that did it...
Should work
Important one: Debug/**/*.o
Debug/**/*.o
.cproject
desktop.ini
.classpath
.project
.settings/
build.properties
build.xml
Debug/
Unit Tests
.gitignore:
Just don't check them in
Ok
You don't - linker needs those 
how do I keep it from generating new .o?
ok, removed all of the .o's but kept the directory structure
<@U1F0LEQ3W> uploaded a file: <https://skunkworksteam1983.slack.com/files/U1F0LEQ3W/F4MK1B7PH/Untitled.sh|Untitled> and commented: it's happy after I did this
If you copy src into Debug and remove everything that isn't a directory, that should do it 
Just did the same thing you did, looks like you need to recreate the directory structure of the project under Debug
Should be Debug, not src
Check your build configuration to see where build artifacts are supposed to be going
Also it's a bit weird that .o gets written into source tree - is that the pattern with other files?
Is there a src/Commands/Shooter directory?
repo is in a non protected directory (rw permissions for any program
Assembler messages:
Fatal error: can't create src\Commands\Shooter\cSpinUpShooter.o: No such file or directory
rebuilt
Deleted everything in Debug/
<@U1F0LEQ3W> trying to fix Debug and remove *.o from the repo
<@U1F1ETJM7> shared a file: <https://skunkworksteam1983.slack.com/files/U1F1ETJM7/F4KRPSW2V/everything_we_want_to_do|Everything we want to do>
Yup yup
yeah I know. Just want to list everything we want to do
Yeah but an alliance with two shots at the auto rotor might be more better off, if we are setting priorities 
hopper auto as well
Yeah, easy
a little shimmy
Maybe a gear agitator if we don't get a different gear collector to randomize relative peg position?
I agree
Really a side auto with shoot would be huge
right
we're not going to get much time with the robot with the new gear collector going on and the shooter motors moving
I'm looking for side projects basically, anything that isn't super necessary but would still be useful
Right
With or without I'm finr
Idk 
Both
...hit or lined up right?
Same for retrieval zone
On the far side it's hard for me to see if I've hit the airsip
but I dunno
not sure how much you'd use it on the airship
Hm
Yee
if you're square or not?
Lining up with airship
for?
Leds seem good
Yee thanks
thats fair. just wanted to check to see if anything would help
yes
Yes chute door
You da driver
*time
Checking with the camera wastes tome
occasionally but we have a human player to indicate that
I thought I was seeing gear delivery blocked by stuff on ground that driver didn't know about?
We need to make every part of the robot telescoping
I don't think I'd use it
not much we can do there unless we can program the robot to be taller
driver camera is a pretty serious context switch that should basically only be a last resort if we're completely lost, but we don't really get completely lost
right, just trying to think if theres a solution
squaring up is the easy part
alignment issues are left/right more than crookedness
Yes - esp for gear pickup
im thinking big leds for lining up or something
driver camera?
<@U1F0LEQ3W> anything that would help drive team visually?
maybe? I talked with dave, dont fully remember
right, and it should make it have less energy loss per shot
Belt drive allows 2 motors to not fight each other I think
yea
belt driven shooter is just a more lax pid
&amp; belt driven shooter, i heard
need to be ready for the floor gear collector
jeez I keep forgetting that was the idea
shooter PID probably can't be much better without mechanical changes
size can have occlusion problems
Yup
vertical position is probably the easiest and most consistent visual indicator of distance
same
*shudders* I don't know why i'm so against it but I just don't see it as giving us an accurate enough reading
we could just get a rough estimate from the size of the boiler on screen?
nah
that would require lidar which we've never even tried to wire
I don't see it happening but if we have time (lol) we'll try it
maybe use that as an input for our shooter pid? idk
we could try finding distance to the boiler from the pis
Have a good time
Work out sonar
gear placement vision
theres gotta be some stuff
anything else?
no
are we meeting tomorrow?
Probably
if the answer's no thats fine but I want to see it and understand where you're coming from with it
<@U1F0BJN5U> do you have time to go over that auto tomorrow so I can help perfect it before testing so we reduce fiddling time?
putting switch on turret so we can automatically reset the turret pos @ start match
better shoot pid
hopper auto + shoot
Testing side gear auto
boiler vision tracking
<!channel> Even though we don't have robotics until Monday, we need to hit the ground running (3 days, 2 of which realistically at the practice field). What does everybody want to get done by Glacier?
Oops.  Undesirable.
radio fell off 
Rest of match less good. Battery unplugged?
Nice auto in 13!
i think we're reading one switch position on the wrong port also 
when selecting autos we should put the switch to the position farthest from the status light just to be safe

During. Just walk out
Are we going to the practice field before or after team meeting? 
coach kinda wanted earlier but was hesitant because of dinner being provided
think out of bag time is going to start at 6, but ask coach tomorrow
you're not here already?
What's the plan for practice field time tomorrow? When are we headed over!
list of things we need to do on comp bot tomorrow in approximate priority order:
1. make sure gear auto still works
2. check turret/shooter setpoints for new autos
3. set setpoints by alliance color
4. add ramping back in to shooter PID (use Tanvir's implementation or do it in hardware; see page 48 of the Talon manual)
5. use auto selection switches
6. drive straight with encoders
7. make new turret position buttons work
Could be useful:<https://github.com/killmous/git-rekt>
pass control of programming over to a United Nations subcommittee
remove vote functionality
cant rename it now
make eli push his code to base
we're in too deep
rename AutoBase to cAutoBase
Rename all files to variations of cHaveAGoodTime.h
ok this time, kill bella instead
kick bella

Github is yelling at me to commit all my changes, despite not having uncommitted changes, so I'm going to go ahead and try that tomorrow. The gear pathing is on the MikeGearPath branch though
Spiffy - Eli can you review, since you guys have both thought about this?
I'll make a pull request
Let's have dead reckoning side lift auto code ready to deploy just in case
lol
school. we're promised a robot by the beginning of meet tomorrow tho 
School or practice field tonight?
Erik and I are a miss for today as well
I won't be at robots today
If we can get plexi behind the lifts that might matter to the sonar - plywood is probably a bit more dead
Field immediate needs are 2 more lifts, and properly located+tilted high goal.  How they actually look is unimportant until we get to vision but location must be accurate.  Andy is building lifts I think.  We can just nudge the whole boiler 3 inches into the field if we don't want to recut the hole in the top, and don't ever plan to drive up to its front.
Not sure why we haven't been seeing them more often really
gitignore doesn't work on files that are already added to the repository and the .o files were added January 3
It's a shame that coach doesn't want us using the RPis if we're not completely ready with everything, but I understand the reasoning. There's a small chance that the pis could have caused an issue early in the day but we don't really know. I think that as long as we can get the practice field more accurate (and that's on us to make sure that happens), we can tune it as well as we can and then test during setup at Central.
So I'm not super happy with the process that got us to "no RPi for you" status - especially the fact that you guys weren't part of it - but taking a step back I realize it doesn't actually change the mission. We need to have failsafes in place regardless, and that means autos that can deliver gears and shoot fuel even when RPi's are on fire, and even when the sonar sensors are dangling from broken wires. The order of tasks is unchanged: dead reckoning no sonar, dead-ish reckoning with sonar, and finally with vision.  I'd think that would all be the same code, with logic to deal with dead subsystems like sonar or vision. So heads up, carry on, kick some butt.
That's what gitignore is for, for sure
we should get rid of those .o files
"coincidentally"
use base
oh, coincidentally, base is now the default branch and master is protected so it can't be messed with
By optimizing as many routines as possible without losing user friendliness, Notepad++ is trying to reduce the world carbon dioxide emissions. When using less CPU power, the PC can throttle down and reduce power consumption, resulting in a greener environment. ~<http://notepad-plus-plus.org>
code is now on base
<@U1F1ETJM7> yes
note: in cmotor, make sure to intialize m_timestall
thats fair

about what?
oh that makes way more sense
talking to coach
rip
<@U1F0LEQ3W>
<@U1F0LEQ3W> pls
because i means implements
and iMaster implements cMaster right?
You could call it "/b/"
we need to make two new branches: iMaster and cMaster
and make a new one called masterA
we can rename the current one to master1
can we rename branches?
so <@U1F0LEQ3W> I should branch off of my most recent commit on HEAD?
never mind
b for bella
(b for branch)
how about bMaster
how about instead of "master" we have "Master"
:benton_irl:
lol HBN
master_backup_backup_backup_backup_backup_backup_backup

at work we have a new-master
not saying this is a good idea, but
base?
what should I name if its gonna become default?
thats fair
so basically I think we make a new branch and make it the new default

I'm already sick


please get me sick
I'm not that sick, mostly exhaustion and stuffy nose, but definitely don't want to get anyone sick.
That's sick :the_horns:
Don't get us sick man
I might be able to make it over to the practice field as well if we do go there
tho*
I'm not going to be at robots today, wasn't at school cause of sickness. I plan on at least dedicating 6-9 working on robots to
I hope so - would like to get busy on autos
Will we be at the practice field today?

Pretty sweet seeing that auto gear btw 
Either way no game video, I hear
actually maybe. we don't know
we don't think that the power draw was actually an issue

Do the laptops have the most current version of master
builds on master
On master, don't know if it works, somebody should check that
The laptops are in the tool chest, I have an Ethernet cable
Robots is now
so what's the plan for tonight? robots or no robots 
Do we have laptops charged and Ethernet cables packdd
Putting stuff on my branch now
<@U1F1ETJM7> what about your stuff
I still have some changes I'm working on 
not quite yet, regarding master 
Everything packed?
Is master up to date?

Cool cool
Ok
BTW we are down two rPi now - one is smoked and other has borken camera connector.  I'd feel better if we had spares in the pit, I think coach may have some intended for balloon bots.  We could swap the one with bad connector at least
Some of us will be gone setting up for comp
Are we meeting Friday?

Did we decide what direction the leads should be facing on the camera? 
I'll be there - meet at skül?
Not sure when I'll be in tonight, have a lot to do at work
One was on comp bot already, other is now
I think they matter less on comp bot than practice bot, really
Mounted in pi boxes
Then there are at least 2 within 50 feet of you 
Yeah 
Where is all this happening?  Shop?
Pretty sure we handed off the comp bit pair already
But I think there's just one
I expect so - don't have it here at my desk
<@U2KD3E39A> are all the pis in that kit? 
Autocorrek 
Pi boxes
There are 4 installed in public boxes tho
Your call - wherever they do most good
Do you want us to take them off the practice bot
I will momentarily
Ask electrical?
I thought they were already installed - must be somewhere in the shop
<@U2KD3E39A>  <@U1F0WAUUS> which pis and where are they
Wdym
That's not helpful
Both if we have them there I guess
We've got the comp bot out of the bag, do you want any pis installed

Do you have practice bot yet?   They are waiting for Mr. Bowlin before unbagging.
There'll be practice field time tonight

Oki doki
can someone @ the prac field now make sure the practice boiler gets to the school ?
I'm going to go ahead and guess we're not going to the practice field today

Thanks Rachel :expressionless:
apparently we love our programming subteam
OK - I just wanna be sure I don't ding anything, will diff manually
wasn't in git because system-dependent paths

yep

im sorry what

ick, but ok i guess - is there a diff function?
yeah we did so we source control it thru slack
I thought we had some trouble with .cproject being git controlled?  I'd for sure prefer to have be standardized.
or everyone just makes the change themselves
yeah
to slack
gotta push .cproject probably
<@U1F0LEQ3W> now that we're at no-warnings build state I'd like to enable -Werror - but its not clear to me how that change flows to the team?

I'm having trouble installing whatever can I get some help? 
I'll be available on slack/phone/whatever

Gyro is input to a PID that adjusts the ratio between motor speeds and encoders were just used to tell when to stop
I thought that's what we were doing
also benton should have a mount done by the start of the meeting (he claims)
as an error feedback for the pid
for the auto
Or do you mean gyro only without encoders?
You mean for testing?
<@U1F0LEQ3W> if the gyro was working, could we use that for an error value and just not have motor feedback?
Thanks 
It's in the oi
I left my laptop charger at the practice field, does anyone have it?
Things better tonight?
Yep
You guys still at it?
That certainly seems productive.

2 hours
Bag open at 3 <@U1F0LEQ3W> <@U1F0LEEE9> 
Benton is talking sense into coach right now about the hopper
No time to test other shit
Shooter encoder functioning?
Were the pis talking?
That does complicate things.  Encoder on turret functioning?
We haven't unbagged yet 
Like I said everything is fucky
Nope
Drivebase encoders OK?
Today they're doing driver practice until 4-5
Yesterday around 5
Descriptive.  What time did we get to the practice field?  
Why
Electrical is giving me shit
Everything was fucked
What happened last night?
I'm going to be at school around 2:30
Just talked with Benton, prob 3 hours
We'll probably be done with practice around 4-5
Not sure
They probably won't need us until later
2 or 3 hrs?
I don't think I can be there at 1
Check to see what they're doing with it
At 1, but someone should be there and make sure things that need to be tested get tested
Everything was fucky we didn't get far
At 1? For mechanical only or?
No 
did you guys get the turret tested last night?
But they're taking the robot out of the bag at school around 1, somebody should be there to test jt
We dunno
How long is practice going to go?
Yea 
Are you guys still working?

Alright, I need to pull from master then, bc I'm not seeing it. Thanks
AutoBase.h
const eAlliance alliance = Red;
Is there? What's it called?
remove const tho
it has been confirmed
there's a global variable in autobase i think
Is there any way currently in the code to determine whether we are on the red or blue alliance? The auto for gear placement will need to vary based on whether the field is mirrored.
We're going to the practice field sometime after lunch
I'll be in after lunch. Are we still at school?
Practice field + comp bot maybe
Meet at school 9:30 or 10
OK?
what's the plan tomorrow ?
It's always been brken
We're just using it for the first time
Ourselves
It's not suddenly breaking
who can we blame
Why is everything suddenly breaking
???
When we spin up the shooter the OI forgets the buttons exist and then the shooter doesn't stip
Sorry I'm not there today, coach said we weren't meeting
The drivebase is squirrelly but it's ok
Yes
Fires extinguished, does it work
No
Did you? Lol
Did anyone mess with the left CIMS in the code 
I think it's something with encoder values rn
Voltage is fine
Voltage?
Hm
How far not up?

Also, we keep dropping robot comms :/
Just something to look into tomorrow 
It runs 
Everything just blew up at work, <@U1F1ETJM7> can you troubleshoot
Also, a log fell into the robot 
It was all the waybup
Have the belts skipped?
Was it all the way up when you turned it on?

A series of very precise lightning strikes seared the word “OMEN” into the rust-red sand of the Sonora Desert; scientists blamed “phytoplankton”.
Pieces of paper with the word “OMEN” written on them fell from the clouds. A beached whale was seen in the night sky. Babies left unattended began to roll slowly, but unmistakeably, uphill.
Rivers flowed uphill. A new star was seen in the night sky. A butchered pig was found to have the word “OMEN” written on its liver in clearly visible letters.
In retrospect, there had been omens and portents.

I got it to work
The code on the practice bot doesn't work and the code currently on master doesn't work?
stop texting in class tanvir
No phones in the shop
 I'm not in class I'm in the shop
Stop texting in class
do you have an earlier version that isn't terrible
it doesn't build and I need to deploy code
eli your code is really broken
We should get a picture of the priority list so that we don't lose if if anybody comes in and wants to use the white board
where did they come from cotton eye merge conflicts
where did they go
where did these come from
that awkward moment when you randomly get merge conflicts
blame ailis
CLOSE THE DOOR
since i cant chime in
You can merge later
That's fine
i'll delete it
whoops already made a new branch
Make a new branch off master for this once Eli has merged, we don't want this ending up in the main codebase
oki doki
One for switching the left and right joysticks, one for removing a cim from each side of the drivebase, and one for each encoder
Need a fourth joystick in the OI with 8 buttons, which each knock something out when pressed
How do you want me to "selectively disable" the robit
(they almost certainly wont let us bring it there until they do)
Need to fix up the turret and drivebase before we can go to the practice field probably
Yep
So meeting is at RAHS tonight?
Gotta learn them fancy moves
Love sulfating me some defense
Lol OK
We'll have defense to simulate defense
We've got 2016 bots to simulate defense
Drive in a straight line even if you're being defended
Also we could do like multipliers to the joystick inputs to simulate defense
but oki doki
Interesting
sounds sketch
"Selectively disable"
Selectively "disable" parts of the robot for practice dealing with a broken robot during matches without accidentally actually breaking the robot
What's the tool?
Working on cleaning up my code
&gt;.&gt;
shhhhhh
(I.e. not during class)
As soon as you guys can get together to make it
When do you want that list
I can work on that, I've nothing to do
In addition to the competition code, I have a driver training tool that I'll need someone to make in a separate branch
Eli, we need your branch cleaned up and merged into master so we're all on the same page
Make a list of things that need to be done (including both coding and testing) and sort by priority for the first district next week
Probably that too
We need to start tonight with triage
Did the belts get fixed?
Mechanical may want to finish fixing the shooter and get bumpers on before anything else happens with the robot
BTW if you go early plz take the cardboard boiler and gear spike setups, and the roll of retro reflective tape (but do NOT let anyone stick it onto the boilers at the field until they've been painted some plausible shade of steampunk brown)
What's the plan for tonight?
why we use unsigned double :upside_down_face:

Good luck with Bag day!

We won't be going to the practice field
If anyone has work to do that doesn't require the robot or vision systems on the robot, the school opens at 9am tomorrow. If you want to help another subteam, check with them first.

yes thank you for your ever lasting cynicism
Very Constructive of you.  If I ever said anything nice about you, I would now, but of course I don't.
i was getting mad so I had to do something
Sounds like it shouldn't be too long.  Thanks for keeping things moving.
We're 10 wires away and the hopper
I was in there the entire meeting building and wiring
K.  Thanks for hanging out.  You folks are great.
Coach said 10
What time do we start tomorrow?
Coach kicked us out
They're not done wiring it
To confirm our auto routines are perfect now that we have the robot?
trust me 
just another 45 
I assume you have the robot and it is really cool.
It has been an hour since the last time it would be 45 minutes.
That sounds like hardware.  I don't sully my hands with such concrete pursuits.
how fast can you build a robot
k.  Anything I can help with?
still "working"
They still working on it, or did things fold up until tomorrow?
The limits on what else goes in the bag are pretty lax as I recall.
I don't remember any rules against it.
i don't think theres anything in the manual against that
I think we will have to put small holes in the bag so they can breathe.  And food and water into the bag.  Also a bucket.
idk man they're pretty legit
They might have been exaggerating though
that is mildly concerning
I asked Victor and Isaac when they'd be done with whatever they're working on and they said 7 days.
"no no this time its really gonna be 45 minutes"
It'll be done in 45 minutes
Robot?  It has been 45 minutes.:grinning:
please stop nathan
-bella
:ok_hand:
ok.
i mean theres a lot of shade its hard to see
i can assure you i can see them on my computer
can you not see them?
they're there
De nada.  Why the "mock" routines?  (I might know if they had headers that explained...)
gracias
Working on it.
yes please review my pull request : &gt;
I am missing all the fun.
until they kick us out like last night
I get it.  How late are things going?
everytime we ask electrical theyre like "45 minutes i promise"
no no its a quote
Don't make promises other people have to keep.  Does Nathan need review on a pull rqst?

guess who lied and told us we would get a turret
us
hey guess whos getting a turret
It'll just be another 45 minutes
nvm
Ugh
45 minutes
Bummer.  Do we have an ETA?
gud joek
surprise :tada:

Any progress?
I have the rpis - will take to electrical

thanks
ok sick
which is it
Utility
of the three categories being: interface, utility, or subsystem
Service
ok, so
Not a command
PID input
looks like a command
At a guess it's a pid for the udp
is it a command or...
PID input based on values from UDP
anyone know what pidudp is ?
changing directories of files is driving me crazy :upside_down_face::upside_down_face::upside_down_face:
prob same
What time do we start sat am? Usual or earlier?
Gear stations 1and 3 are mirrors of each other
Wait was thinking turret but still same idea
Way
Nope - it's going to be wrong for half the matches if it's wrong at all, but I don't think it will be wrong either wat
(can't do centered)
<@U1F0WAUUS> <@U2KD3E39A> Do we care if the gear camera is mounted left of center or right of center?
ok, i'm working on testing the gear collector code on an actual mechanism (yay!), but i'll check that out soon
I'll might also be gone getting dinner when you get here
Ok, Eli's leaving for dinner and will be back in an hour
I'm leaving work soon
The things I listed earlier are the things we need to get done, so any of those that no one else is doing
pls send help
ive hit a wall with unit testing, anything else I can do?
I think I missed something here
:+1::skin-tone-3:
thx
got em
?
chute door?
Yes
there is much box
Pretty sure
In a box buried
we looked
its not there

Ok I got the gear ratios, should I upload to slack or just put it in the code and push to git
Think that covers what we need to do today
I'll go talk to design
Find gear ratios/wheel diameters and put them in code
Also figure out our conversions from motor turns to outputs
I'll talk to desivla right now bout that

Re color sensor - electrical owes us a gizmo to multiplex them since they share same i2c address
Navx definitely has some disadvantages, like weird reset behavior and an overly prescriptive API, so we should see if the other gyro is better
That's the question
Why would we want i2c gyro?
Test bang bang shooter control vs PID
Get automatic gear scoring working
See if we want to use i2c gyro instead of navx and how to get it on the bus
Figure out how we're going to talk to two of them at once
Hey guess what other desilva just said we should do
Also need to see if we're talking to the color sensor right
sweet sweet
Eventually
Cool cool.
Are you coming in today?
Tanvir's got making the shooter only have one PID by slaving one talon to the other

Electrical can wire us up a guitar hero guitar for control if we want that
exactly.
If they really needed to know they would have figured it out themselves 
sure. We should really get on the whole telling electrical things thing
Red v blue, and position 1,2 or 3
I liked the physical switch idea, don't know if electrical heard of it
and what we actually want for auto selection
I'm with you, but we need to figure out if electrical knows that
but up to you guys
my opinion is that smart dashboard sucks
I'm thinking rng for the arguments to the commands
^
I say rng
if we're doing it another way (smartdashboard), are we ready to accept SD input?
if we're doing physical selection, have we told electrical we need that?
<@U1F0LEQ3W> <@U2KD3E39A> <@U1F0LEEE9> have we worked out how we're doing autonomous selection yet?

We're just doing a branch per person this year so we can do it commit by commit
And it's easier on the reviewer.
Both, ideally.  Reduces merge conflicts.
Branches or commits?
Let's try to keep branches to s single purpose- a lot of changed in there and I'm not sure they're what you wanted me to review
Ok left some reviews
I'll take a look
yeah there already is one it's called "Nathan: fixed messenger" or something 
Can you put up a pull request?
is someone available to review my code?
<@U1F0LEQ3W> coach just told me; turret has a gear ratio of 9.14:1
Hail science!
praise the flying spaghetti monster: messenger is fix !!!
We're fine here, if we get stuck we'll go home and wait for tomorrow
I've got some things to do tonight, so if no one's going to be desperately spinning their wheels for the next four hours otherwise, think I'll skip
If you want to come over we'll stick around and keep working
He's been at it for hours
not much is going on, having trouble with messenger but should be resolved soon (hopefully)
Leaving work soon, anyone need help enough that I should come in?
I'll try to get to it today if I have time
Its Tanvir, Nathan and I right now here
With the "Debug" and "Unit Tests" build configurations
Could one of you guys try checking out the unit-tests branch and building it with the .Cproject config I posted
estoy
who's coming today?
I'll probably get in between 10 and 11
When do we meet on Sunday?
we should all think about making a big to-do list so we can know what needs to be finished in this last 12d

i was forced to say these things. it was extortion
this is a funny
teehee
why don't we hook up a pidcontroller for the values of the turret's pid control? :slightly_smiling_face:
Just occurred to me, we may need different PID tuning on turret depending upon whether or not shooter is spun up.
I've been doing some trajectory stuff but not actually touching the motors
I'm not texting 
 Erik stop texting in class
I was working on gear detecting, nothing with motors 
I think Erik was working on that
The manual turret command runs talons, so no
Is that actually driving the servos on totebot yet?
Tanvir's been doing shooter code and Bella did a command for manually moving the turret
who's been working on turret/shooter code?
Sorry
 Sort
Also if you leave a bunch of cracker crumbs on the floor, grab a vacuum from the shop and clean them up (Mike)
Someone forgot their battery pack, I'm putting it in the cupboard with the other stuff
Info on using static IPs on the field - we should update our spreadsheet and code:  <http://wpilib.screenstepslive.com/s/4485/m/24193/l/319135-ip-networking-at-the-event>
OK
We have school
Unless otherwise noted yes
Is there a meeting today?
Though h264 frame rate is not constant, from what I read
Yeah I think raspivid defaults to 25fps
oh?
16 is in the range of realtime, so probably not too different from what you perceived 
no, I'm just surprised becasue it seemed a lot higher on playback
Your FPS was higher?  I got those numbers by playing back vid for single cycle BTW
weird
That's playback on a test vid actually
I haven't had a chance to add threading yet. I'll try to get to that later tonight after the homework I put off last night.
oh because you don't have an ir filter on
16 fps on windows?
Haven't put it on the rpi yet, but here are some numbers with the github-eli code on my windows box: 16FPS with no changes, 54FPS with all debug+graphics off, 57FPS with no graphics or UDP send. That will scale down on rpi I expect, but with UDP on a seperate thread I'm hopeful it will be fast enough. Now I gotta go actually find that rpi
logging &amp; command stuffs 
what's everyone else working on tonight?
Cool
I have an old rpi2 at home, that should be a good acid test for FPS goals
Spiffy
It will be updated later tho
It's all on github on the Eli branch
Your Python image processing plus UDP transmit
Post what code? 
Post your code where I can get at it and I'll look at it tonight
The counter was buggy from the start so we removed it, I'll re implement it today
FPS?
Not very
How close to fast enough are we?
So simple
Yes, but do simple to try
Right but the code to implement and manage it is
That is, threading is not actually Python specific
Python makes that easy - and I think you'd want it in c++ too, where it's less easy
My concern is writing very python specific code without knowing if we're using Python or not (ie threading code)
It comes down to performance - my instinct is that clean Python code should do fine - most of the heavy lifting is done by opencv and numpy, which are C++ under the covers
<!channel> we need to decide really soon if we're going to do python or c++ for opencv
Interesting
It's what I had to do to get my frame rate up when I was playing with this.
With the current target info in a shared global variable, and one thread updating target info as fast as it can, and the other thread pumping it out over UDP as fast as it can.  (No rpi needed for development, of course)
Hey vision pythonistas - have you looked at using threads to decouple frame processing from transmission of target location data?
Anyone at the school today
Nice
Das good
2nd VRM is allowed per Robot rule R56
okay
I'll be at robotics late
I'm here
Anyone still at the school?
Otherwise you can search the project for it and it should be pretty straightforward to fix
Compiler output should have the offending definition and where it was first defined
Yeah also check header guards ^ (look them up)
Include file used more than once , maybe?
That may have been my bad
Check cPIDUdp
anyone have any ideas why when rpi_ip in robotmap is a const char* i get an error for multiple definitions?
Optional meeting at the school
Is there something that isn't tryouts today?
who's coming today?
Gonna be late to robots, presenting at the mof
oh lol ok
My mom is still trying to figure out what she's serving 
why?

So it looks like we will need to build our own 950nm IR lights out of individual LEDs.  Nobody has premade ones in stock that I can find. Grrr.
I emailed the spreadsheet link to coach
it's been removed in the current version of the git repository, which makes git delete it when you merge from master
BEFORE YOU MERGE FROM MASTER, back up your .cproject file
And what IP addresses we'll use of the robot
Also with a place to declare what UDP ports go where

steps for running unit tests:
1. `scp` your test executable onto the test machine using the linux-test.pem private key; for example:
```scp -i Downloads/linux-test.pem src/eclipse/2017Steamworks/test/Test  <mailto:ubuntu@ec2-52-32-208-36.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com|ubuntu@ec2-52-32-208-36.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com>:/home/ubuntu```
2. `ssh` onto the test machine:
```ssh -i Downloads/linux-test.pem <mailto:ubuntu@ec2-52-32-208-36.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com|ubuntu@ec2-52-32-208-36.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com>```
3. use the `runTest` command on your test executable:
```ubuntu@ip-172-31-18-124:~$ runTest Test 
Running main() from <http://gtest_main.cc|gtest_main.cc>

Yeah, especially for Windows Python is a great way to get into openCV (or anything really - there's an amazing range of libraries for Python).  Could even use in production on rpi if performance is adequate. Though as project complexity rises I'm less keen on Python, but maybe I've just not found the right tools.

theres gonna be a ton of math this year... I love it
we can do math for angle based on dHeight from the cam
Assuming we can see the spike in IR it will be an excellent marker for approach angle

we talked about doing that last year but didn't get around to it
It would be super useful if we could store all raw video from rpi cams during matches for later use in tuning the vision systems. Could be done local to the robot with cheap USB drives.

do we need more?
not that I know of, but you can ask coach to order them
should I order one or are there some on the way?
trying to figure out what kind of power supply to use with the rpi
fair fair
or Brad saw that there was official code for it and decided that meant he wouldn't have to deal with it
strange
something like that
so basically ctr told wpi "dont include it"?
not by WPI, CTR decided they wanted to put out their own library
is CANTalon no longer officially supported or?
thats weird, whys that?
<http://www.ctr-electronics.com/control-system/hro.html#product_tabs_technical_resources> download "CTRE Toolsuite (No Installer)" and follow the instructions in the readme
<!here|@here> the CANTalon class has been removed from WPILib, so if you haven't already, you should download the new library that has it

True
I'm not sure it would perform any better than just measuring the angle with a regular camera
For three pointers it could help
Yes. I would only start looking at the kinect if you have a need for a depth sensor.
Tho it may be late to start looking at a new system.  We know how to use RPi from last year.
$100 problem then.
Second, is hardware issues. You're probably going to want to use the kinectv2 as the limitations on the v1 are rough.
Part of what I was looking at is a package that covers a lot of that.
First challenge is going to be processing.
:salt:
Besides being scarred from abandonment in my tender adolescent years? Perfectly fine.
Are you ok Eli 
In all seriousness how come?
As always I would defer to Thomas. 
I think it's a pathway to a good deal of wasted time. Wonderful off season project though. 
When he abandoned us, as if we were a dog that was worth no more than a stray
Goodness he says, as if he doesn't fully understand the pain we felt
So what's the beef with Kinect?
Goodness 
When you left us the first time and shattered our hearts
*yet you never said goodbye*
&lt;_&lt;
I never left. Always watching.

There's a reason it's vapor ware technology. 
The kinect is deceptive. 
No. 
I guess that even if we own it, it's a fair chunk of change against allowed total cost of parts.  Still might be worth it tho - you can do some fairly high level stuff with it fairly easily, from what I've heard

Don't we have a Kinect in the programming cabinet ?

From what I remember the brownout code worked pretty well, but we didn't want it because we wanted to go super fast.
Eh at least the Blame finally worked out for us
Nice to know we're loved tho
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Just not any severe issues I guess
So what was coach talking about?
Or the radio
Brownouts aren't the biggest deal. Brownouts are the result of builtin managing of subsystems so that the roborio doesn't die all the time and restart
No for sure we have brownouts
And we didn't want to include code on master that could potentially disable subsystems if it wasn't perfect
But no brownouts?
i.e. I just don't think all the bugs ever got worked out
Heh
...Didn't work out too well.
Cool
Instead of the bot just shaking and dying
So that if we dropped below a certain voltage (I know thats not current keep your pitchforks away) we would start disabling subsystems in a controlled manner
How works that
Yeah we tried to implement brownout control
Current limiting in software?  There's so much I don't know
:cold_sweat:
...run and hide
I think that's us
He reffered the people to programmers
(or see what our drivebase is probably going to look like)

I agree with everything but the eclipse thing. It's actually better (gasp) at arduino, it doesn't store stuff on network drives unless you explicitly tell it to
<!channel> If you are still trying to get the Arduino bot moving, I have figured out how to get a school laptop to compile and upload in a fairly reasonable amount of time.  Sorry I didn't do this a few weeks ago:

If you are running the Arduino IDE, quit out of it.
In Windows Explorer, copy the Arduino directory from c:\Program Files(x86) to c:\
Now you have a directory c:\Arduino - open that in Windows Explorer and create a new directory c:\Arduino\Sketchbook
Now start the Arduino IDE as c:\Arduino\Arduino.exe
Use the Files | Preferences menu item to open the Preferences dialog
At the top of the Preferences dialog, it gives the current location of the sketchbook, something like \\shares\studenthome\S-1234567890\Arduino - make a note of that.
Change Sketchbook location to "c:\Arduino\Sketchbook" 
Use Windows Explorer to copy everything in \\shares\studenthome\S-1234567890\Arduino into c:\Arduino\Sketchbook.
From now on, do all your work on files in and under c:\Arduino
On Erik's school laptop with this configuration, initial compile and upload of a moderately complex robot program took 36 seconds.
A small change to the program took only 8 seconds to recompile and upload.  That starts to be a reasonable turnaround time.

Let's see if we can't have all 6 robots working on Tuesday!  The cake will be delicious and moist.

I suspect we will want to do a similar thing for Eclipse and the RoboRio.

One thing to remember is that moving off the student network share comes at the cost of "no more automatic backup".  So get in the habit of emailing yourself diffs, or setting up a private github repo, or something.  When we're in season we can't be worrying about lost laptops etc.
Hayel yeah

Thank you guys

nah, I just unjinxed it by pointing it out
see thomas I didn't jinx it
Nice!

It's a coping mechanism 
Shhhhhhh
why'd you have to go and jinx it
I think it'll work this time 
:partyparrot:
I did
^^
make sure you select the port in the IDE before you upload
Changed USB port. Comes up as  arduino. Gonna build again
if you do, try plugging the arduino into that and check if the IDE will see it, and if it won't, check if device manager knows what it is
do you still have the IDE on that surface laptop you had the other day?
ok, so windows isn't recognizing it
Usb port*
Different port?
I don't have admin to change things either 
It showed up as unknown device. Windows is unable to install driver software 
and could you go into device manager and make sure the arduino shows up as an arduino
It finished. Same error as before 
I'll try that when it's finished uploading 
could you go into your settings (File &gt; Preferences &gt; Settings) and enable verbose output during compilation and upload?
D:
Eh it's going on 13 for me and it's not even past 25%
yeah <@U1F0L9PEK> it takes 10 mins to compile on the school laptops
Still compiling... :expressionless:
Lol
Nope it's not. I'm sorry. 
¿Pero comó?
Should be able to pass params to the builder. 
She's running it in the arduino ide, dunno how she can pass that without a console

It's going well. 
<@U1FAR4AJU> you could try passing the -f override.

Also, <!channel>, I'm thinking today is just a work day with no conference room meetings. Remember that for Tuesday each group should have pros and cons of their ideas and a recommended mechanism. If you have finished with that, you may want to try to come up with numbers to support your thinking, do research on Chief Delphi (about the mechanism, not the game!), or do more detailed drawings of how specific parts will fit together (CAD without the computer). Does that sound good?

I pointed out the major concerns to you tonight. Look at those issues objectively and see if you can come up with alternatives that might address them. Mostly, you want to establish a base line of expected performance so you can have a place to collect data for validation. When testing you'll be able note expected and unexpected behavior. That will give you a place to start For further iterations. For a different  perspective and point of view, I highly suggest posting your design on chief delfi and ask for feedback. There are a lot of FIRST mentors and engineers on there that love to help out with student  designs. Some will probably have direct experience with the H drive style that can give pretty good insight on pros and cons. My peeps are old and cranky. Apologies, but I'll spare you from that experience. Chief Delpi will offer you much more constructive advise.
<@U3EHQTKBP> if you could tell me all the details and issues that the engineers that you met with pointed out about my drive base that'd be great. I want to make it the best I can and learn all the way through. Also if you could put me in contact with them directly, so I can really talk to them and work out a viable solution to each problem addressed and learn the most, that'd be great! I'm always looking for the most feedback as possible. Thanks in advance

*geared, my b lul. It's early.
<@U2A68KU8K> What is this gear for in ft/s?
yeah np
Yeah yeah, cool. Thanks fam. 
yeah no problem but heres some pics with the COM that you wanted earlier. Good luck
I will look it over. 
I've got a materials science quiz at 8:00 tomorrow morning, can I hit you back later?

I know my cad skills improved greatly after i built what i made because i was able to see my faults and understand how to improve them
Yes i am slightly concerned but that is why we need to build it and test it. Thats the point of this. Not only would it be a good thing to test and see if its a viable drive base in the future but if we made it in the preseason it would be a great way for freshman and sophomores to get hands on and understand why things are done the way they are, instead of me just telling them to do it that way and they'll understand later.
<@U2A68KU8K> I like your train of thought for #6, are you worried at all about a jack of all trades, master of none scenario?
1. It increases maneuverability without decreasing friction between ground and wheel. It allows us to easily align with the pegs when needed and get out of a pin easily, but also allows us to push other robots around and have maximum control if/when required
2. The trade off is that its more complex and has more moving parts which increases risk of break. The however to this is that an it is designed to be interchangeable and an entire side can be taken off easily or just one wheel set so we can have extra laying around and quickly fix it. The pnuematics all will have springs in them so that if they fail they will defualt to coulsons because that is what i see us using more but we can customize that from what the driver wants because the wheel sets and pneumatics are easily changed.  
3. The weight is roughly 45 lbs 
4. I haven't calculated the cost yet
5. Yes there are other ways to align on a peg but that isnt the only goal of this drive base. It is again to get out of pins and have a full range of motion as well as align with a peg.
6. The benefits of this drive base is that it takes all the best qualities of others and puts them together. Maneuverability of a swerve or mechinum, speed and control of a 6 cim coulson tank drive, agility of omni. My entire goal of this was to make a drive base that encompassed all the perks of other drive bases so that it would be viable in games like steamworks and logomotion
Meaning, for example you mentioned earlier about being able to move left or right to place a gear. Can that same problem get solved by a simpler mechanism at the end effector level.
what do you mean in number 5 <@U3EHQTKBP>
i never undid the 6 cim but the middle one is just for corrections. if we decided we would heavily rely on it then it could be tested but i thought we wanted the acceleration and torque
Let's all block out some time on Tuesday to discuss this drive base.

Be prepared to answer a few of these questions:

1. What problem does it solve?
2. What are the tradeoffs?
3. What is the weight?
4. What is the cost?
5. Can the problem you are trying to solve be achieved at the effector level?
6. What are the benefits of this drive train over other types?
I'm curious why you went back to 6 CIM <@U2A68KU8K> 
 All wheels are powered they're belted together
yeah
Oh right, you can drive the outer omnis... yeah you could do that
Or even just less cheese in back and more cheese in front
but only a small amount
while you are translating
you drive the "drive" omnis into it
Couldn't some mass be added to the back of the robot to pull the COM back?
yeah, I don't see any possible compensation from a control system perspective
got it
yeah
So the pneumatics switch between omnis and colsons on the perimeter, while the 3(?) in the middle as the bar in h stay in contact the entire time (works because they're omnis)
sure, ok
not paytons
yeah, that's just one from the internet
this flips back and forth from the colson and the omni with a piston
the red is the rubber of the colson?
<@U1F0QEL0Z> uploaded a file: <https://skunkworksteam1983.slack.com/files/U1F0QEL0Z/F7RQDMJ3E/pasted_image_at_2017_10_29_07_44_pm.png|Pasted image at 2017-10-29, 7:44 PM>
it'd be a pretty cool juke to spin and translate around a robot
Lemmie picture you up hold on
rip
oh
If we can drive colsons and omnis at the same time, we could compensate with a little bit of twist around center of drivebase rotation
No, that's the thing with his drive base
Do the omnis and colsons touch the floor at the same time?
Actually what's the diameter of the omni
As in the ones on the butterfly, but I don't think it's that bad if they are only 4 inch omni's
Not eli, but yeah that possible, but there is only so much fine control you can get with omni wheels
I think that you might be able to compensate in programming if it was too crazy, am I right <@U1F1ETJM7>?
Exactly.
If its centered then the Omanis should pull it in a line. If it's off then it'll be on an arc
Elaborate on pull, I think you are on the right track.
Yeah kind of because you want to see how much it will pull
Do you understand why I might want to look at that?
If it's close it is nbd.
It's very close but a little off sadly
What I was going to look at was the distance between where the slide wheels contact the ground and the COM.
All good 
I feel it yo, my b.
Oh yeah I can't do that because it's in a360 but it's on the very tip of the mini cim motor axel 
And the orthographic view point is nice for 2D analysis because it keeps things parallel and perpendicular.
COM is Center of Mass.
Oh, my b yo.
 What do you mean 
Can you show COM and make the view type orthographic?

one sec im moving them around for an actual drive base this is just a concept and stand alone
<@U1F0P4FA5> pinned a message to this channel.
Hey <@U2A68KU8K>, can you hook me up with a topdown view of your drivebase with COM shown?
oh lol he doesn't look like Franco actually
For example, us getting to the finals of girls gen :pogchamp:

But who is PogChamp?
PogChamp
I bet that too
I bet it's Franco
No idea, it gets spammed in chat when a streamer does something really cool lol
<@U5BS3Q282> You've been spotted!
Who is it? It looks like Franco
It's not franko btw, its from Twitch lol
Please fill out by Tuesday!
<https://goo.gl/forms/nisU35AHU4UasZGC3>
sure
sure
But <!channel> do you want to vote?
I thought it looked like will scnaith lmaooo
Is it Franco? Looks like Franco
Who is that sticker of?
Anyways, do people want more time for nominations or do they want to vote right now?
Don't forget preseason!
can we please do the sixth one in January?
Rollin bowlin???
Bowlin(g)???
id vote #6 tbh
airsoft/paintball, laser tag, bowling, dodgeball, overwatch, and cading a robot together
What are they 
And one of them I think is unlikely to pass
6, but only 5 serious ideas
how many different ideas have been submitted?
Okay, <!channel>, are you guys ready to vote on design team bonding activities, or do you all want more time for nominations?
Okay, cool, figured that out! Freshmen/sophomores should let me know if there are more sophomores/freshmen I have forgotten to add to this channel
exaclty <@U1F0QEL0Z>
it just makes them copy things
I mean the biggest thing you can get out of doing the early chapters, is figuring out how to do easy stuff really quickly
the book doesnt
it doesnt teach correct pratices
yeah i look over chapter 6-8 and if anything is wrong ill correct or send them back to the right chapter
Yeah, it's a little boring, but we should make sure you have the correct practices down
yeah that's a good idea tucker. from my memory of the CAD book, if you can do chapters 6-12 efficiently then 1-6 is pretty redundant.
then do it
if there is something you don't know
i'd say look through it
Idk, <@U2A68KU8K> what do you think?
I started at chapter 6 for a class b/c I've done a bit of CAD before, but I could do them if you'd like
What about 1-5?
I've done chapters 6-12
Have you started the CAD book?
:+1:
But you are free to stay if you want to
Both teams are above capacity
Yeah and if you are self-selecting design isn't the way to go :laughing:
Yeah sorry I meant that
sorry if it came across that way :/
Just self-selection
Oh lol, they weren't I thought
whoa
I just switched from programming because they were kicking people out
lol he can answer now if he's checking slack <@U7NQFDYBS>
<@U7NQG5GTS> has joined the group
<@U7NQFDYBS> has joined the group
<@U7R0YELFQ> has joined the group
Was he a new freshman entirely or did he just switch to design team on Thursday or was he lost?
Ian just came to thursday so idk what we want to do there
Rachel
Jack
Caleb
Asa
Anthony
Ian???
Then theres two more
Yeah, I'm trying to figure out who the freshmen are for the stuff in the design training thread and so I can add them as soon as they get slack
theres a lot of kids who arent on slack yet
<@U2A68KU8K>
that's a payton thing, I think he knows them the most
<@U7NQFRW8Y> has joined the group
Hey <!channel> which freshmen do I still need to add to the design team channel?
I will once my internet starts working
updoot, gimmie that fruit
I did
por favor
please
Okay
add us
can you please add us?
What does that all mean?
yo
^^^
same
yeet
Hey <!channel> I made a separate channel to organize training freshmen/sophomores, so we don't clog up the design slack with all of that business. If you are a junior, senior, or honorary junior or senior, let me know if you want to be added to that channel
Oh yeah
Probably at least someone with keys to school
Does the mentor for extra time have to be the coach?
Let's see how quickly we can get going with the designs for everything else, and if we can possible get more time from our mentors. Maybe advisory board reps should push for a coach that is willing to put in extra hours
I think it's a cool project, we just have to integrate it into the mock build season, which is ridiculously easy. Just have a formal design review, some documentation, and then I think we can start building it like in real build season, but I think it might have to be done on extra time. I don't know.
i think it would be an over all great project to have
<@U2A68KU8K> Found it!
you have to @-p without the dash
yeah sure that too?
Btw I still don't know how to search your name Payton
I think the point would be to push ourselves in preseason so we can handle complicated systems in build season if necessary 
but i still think itd be a good thing to test out. I tried to make a drive base that was a combination of all other drivebases capabilities and range of motion and still be practical
yeah thats true
Hard to maintain just means more moving parts to break and repair
i wouldn't say harder to maintain like its a bad thing but no one really has practice with pneumatics besides maybe programmers? i think itd be a good way to teach all the new freshman and sophomores and have another drivebase out of the norm. it wouldve been really useful this last year for aligning with the peg and gear drop so i still think itd be a good idea to test out
The difference is the mechanism in the middle to allow it to go side to side
Just harder to build and maintain
basically slippery but the omnis drive also
So mecanum but better
also makes it easy to get out of pinning and still be able to push others around
allows you to go forward and backwards but also side to side for aligning with some type of peg or gear drop
Funky, what does it let you do?
You upload it to Chief Delphi to make it public
It has pnumatics to shift between omni and colson
<@U2A68KU8K> uploaded a file: <https://skunkworksteam1983.slack.com/files/U2A68KU8K/F7RJADY75/pasted_image_at_2017_10_29_12_10_pm.png|Pasted image at 2017-10-29, 12:10 PM>
And maybe, but if it isn't anything new (ie swerve or Omni or something) then we have 2x2016 +2x2017 + slippery + totebot
Upload to a public db or something?
also <@U1F0P4FA5> my name is now searchable youre welcome
yes i will upload before build season but would it be helpful if you had that to program with?
I know for programming we have to make the code Public if we want to reuse it, which is why we do that
I know the main intent of this is to learn design better and that's great, but if you're also planning on using the designs you make now during build season (even if it's only in parts) then there are rules regarding that
Someone should read up on the rules regarding using material from times outside of build season during build season
Especially robots with pneumatics
<@U1F1ETJM7> would this be useful for programming to have more robots?
I doubt it. It would be something I would of have the freshmen work on building after they were shop certified so they get real experience. It always helps to build something so they know why to design it that way 
Possibly, depending on the complexity of the components that we decide to build.
Yeah, I imagine if we could get more people on it it would be good shop practice, I just don't see where it fits in schedule. Maybe we will find extra time?
Although I am and will continue to push to build this because it would be a great prototype for a real drive base 
Design***
Okay, yeah I was only questioning the word "build"
Sorry for the confusion
Yes
Yes everything is staying in cad but we are using my pre designed drive base 
You're welcome 
And Payton how am I supposed to tag u in anything with that crazy username? :laughing:
Yeah, but there is a section saying build drive base, and it was my understanding everything was staying in cad, esp since I didn't see any time for build on the schedule from Thursday
yes, that was my understanding as well
I thought we were using mine? 
We're using a pre-designed drive base
Oh, I just noticed the build drive base part under us. When did we plan on doing that?

We are almost done
I can
<!channel> Can someone let me know when Lego sorting is over?
<!channel>
<https://goo.gl/forms/Snq8v5WqSnpYVRjc2>
Woo suggest team bonding activities!
<!channel> 
Okay, I'm not sure how long we will be sorting Legos on Thursday, but assuming everyone helps out and gets it done by 7, I'm thinking we spend half an hour on setting ground rules for MBS and then another half hour on resetting our schedule. Sound good?
<@U7QG71DP1> has joined the group
<@U7LGS4HA4> has joined the group
So maybe we are looking at
7:00-7:15: Talk to Mr. Smith?
7:15-7:25: Team-Bonding?
7:25-7:30: Results of survey
7:30-8:00: Start on MBS ground rules and schedule, finish on Thursday
Oh right I forgot about that
Isn't it voting today? I was expecting that ordeal to take most of the meeting
I know this is late, but this is what I was thinking for an agenda for tonight:
6:30-6:45: Talk to Mr Smith?
6:45-6:55: Team-Bonding?
6:55-7:00: Mock Build Season Game Decision
7:00-8:00: Ground Rules for Mock Build Season &amp; Schedule (Girls may/may not have to leave for Girls Gen prep)
Does that sound all right to everyone?
That’s too
I meant the survey she couldn't complete
^
She hasn't decided whether she's moving to marketing yet, if I understand correctly
Wait, are u referring to preseason project game survey or other design survey or something else? 
You can still complete it, everyone has until Tuesday
I haven’t decided yet. I’ve been busy all weekend so I was unable to complete the survey. Sorry.
LETS WATCH SPIDER-MAN 
Design team bonding idea: Watch all of the marvel movies lol
ok
Davin doesn't use slack much. 
Engineering ops
Is Davin on this channel? One of the ways it would affect electrical would be by giving design practice for motor, battery, sensor etc. placement
I don't know that mock build would help or hinder us immediately, and besides more time for programmers during build I don't see it directly affecting us. If there's something I'm missing please, point it out
Sure
I don't know enough to hold an opinion, I'm guessing you mean about mock build?
You want me to add you to the list eli? Btw when people respond I'm filling in your name spot on that list.
That'd be nice
I think that elevator mechanisms will be important this year, and even if I'm wrong it's still good to give the whole design team a refresher on elevator mechanisms. So I think a mock build season would be a good idea, and the restricted time frame is a good idea because as a subteam, we need to learn to be faster so we can hand off our mechanisms to other subteams like electrical and programming. During build season, we shouldn't reject good ideas or designs based on the fact that it would take too long to do, so we need that practice to shake off the rust and be prepared for the real build season and not give the programmers a few minutes to test out the code on the comp bot.
<@U1F0KHF71> 
I want to do the mock build season. I believe Anna has moved to marketing 
Just reply to that message if you want, or don't you do you.
So here's a list of what people have said they want to do 
Payton: drive bases and helping freshmen
Henry: I have no clue, I think you wanted to help out with scouting more because of how many kids were on it, but I'm not quite sure if that's true or not
Harrison: you wanted to work on solidworks, and you also were doing drive train stuff with Isaac
Isaac: not sure was working with Harrison
Izzie: systems engineering template and mock build season
Angelina: mock build season
Victor: doesn't want to be constrained by time, wants the team to work quicker think the mock build season will promote that.
David: you've been working on getting the team to function, don't know what you want to do preseason
Thomas:you said mock build season would take too much time, thinking about smaller projects
Tucker: I wanted to work on the mock build season and doing the system engineering stuff, as well as math
Anna: I haven't talked to you in two weeks so I have no clue

If there is anyone else, I assumed you were either working with the freshman or I had no idea what you wanted. Basically, I think if we boil it down to the base things of what we want, then it will be a lot easier to accommodate everyone. If you had the "I don't know" under your name or if what I put down wasn't really descriptive it'd be nice to have a public place so that we all know what we want.
So, to reiterate, everyone needs to fill out the preseason project survey. We may need to spend some time on Tuesday addressing concerns, but regardless we still need to move forward if we want to have a productive preseason. Here's the link again! <https://goo.gl/forms/AQ0OiEIilEePkju13>
I would still suggest that everyone shows up to the subteam meeting on Tuesday
Okay, we could plan something
A team sport for the full design build team 
Full team thing?
We need our own team bonding. Maybe airsoft or soccer or a full team thing. 
How would you know that it would be shut down? And, again, how would you suggest to build trust if you feel you can't even have a conversation? And, again, I understand there are team-wide bonding plans underway
I was helping the freshman and sophomores, who a lot of people have seemed to forget about. My voice wouldn't be heard because everyone in that room would shut me down. I'm not going to name names but there are people who I don't feel comfortable suggesting things around. We fix this by all talking it about and team bonding!!$
So show up to the subteam meeting. Why do you feel like your voice wouldn't be heard, and if that is how you feel, how do you really suggest that we all begin to trust each other?
I know personally, I don't feel like my voice would be heard by the people in the meeting. Yes I know it's a full team thing but we need it especially! We're the biggest sub team and have the argent divide! And the elephant is that there is a divide! Not a little one, a large one right down the middle. 
And what is the elephant in the room?
1. If students wanted to address it, why didn't they attend the subteam meeting?
2. Team bonding is not a subteam issue, I understand there are team-wide plans underway.
I have 2 concerns. 1. Our sub team is divided in half and broken. We don't listen or respect each other in the way that we should. It feels like an us against them type thing. 2. Because 1 is an issue, we won't have a successful mock build season and it will be a waste of our time. If everyone doesn't work together, and at this state, I don't see that happening, we won't make it work. Solution: 1. fix the divide by addressing the elephant in the room then talking it out. 2. Team bonding. 3.   Make us trust each other again, a combination of 1 and 2. 
Sorry, what were your concerns? You have asked if build season is the best idea, and I addressed that. Other than that, I have only heard an argument for why having a full subteam meeting is somehow a bad idea
Izzie, I've brought my concerns to the table to the table many times. I even did today! And that's what this entire conversation has been about but instead of really talking it out and debating, you seem to have closed up and get defensive when I'm trying to talk this out. You haven't seemed to consider the other side yet. I've heard people say it before and I know I have but if we don't feel like we get our voices heard then the only way we could've protested is by just not going. And I'm sorry that it was that way, but again, it shows a larger problem that needs to be addressed. 
Nobody brought their concerns to the table. They just chose not to show up, or decided the subteam preseason project wasn't worth their attention
You're right, but also wrong. If half the team walks out because they don't feel likes a good idea, and you don't address their feelings as to why they think that, you're not catering to everyone. Now sure if one person walked out, yeah, that's wrong, but if half the team does, maybe there's some bigger issues that need to be addressed. 
Walking out on a meeting is not conducive to teamwork
How were the people participating in the preseason project in the wrong?
You're half right, everyone was in the wrong. See we all need to sit down and actually talk about a viable solution to moving forward. See the thing is though, the people who left feel like they are going to have a better impact leaving that meeting then staying. But the people in the meeting feel the same way! We need to fix the team, talk it out, do some team bonding, make us trust each other again! We cannot pretend like there's no divide. We need to become one unit again, not two who don't want to work together 
And what do you suggest to fix that divide? All students were supposed to be at the preseason project meeting, but they made the decision not to work as a team. This cannot be happening going forward, but it is hardly the fault of the people that followed their responsibilities to the subteam
No but we're all kids. We need to stop looking at this entire thing like a business and more like a team! We are kids! This is about having fun. I haven't had fun this season yet. Feelings the hostility between us isn't fun or business professional. If we don't trust each other we will fail. Moving forward in the state that we are in is very dangerous to our success. I don't know if you noticed it, or maybe it was just me, but most of the people in the meeting for the mock build season were kids that wanted to leave the school with 1983 while the kids who weren't in there were the ones who had stayed. So there's an obvious split. When you have half the design build team not wanting to do something, yet you think everyone will do it and you plan that way, it insures nothing but failure. Fix the subteam. It's the only option we have to make us work together 
That doesn't mean we can't all be professional about it
Because we haven't mended our relationships from the split. 
And why is it split in half?
See that's the thing, I don't see us working together. The design team is broken and split in half and moving forward like nothing is wrong is one of the worst ways we can respond to this 
It will only turn out like super bot if we all don't work together
And then design time
After that we can have our kickoff
We only need one more planning meeting
I see this turning out just like super bot, we sit in meetings and talk for 4 weeks and never actually do anything 
And it is the best use of our time because we can practice our design process and basically do a test run
I am working on getting us more meetings and longer meetings. Wilson seems open to the idea and I hear Smith may be able to get us in without her being there
So you're telling me that you think in 14 meetings that are 2 hours, we can make an entire robot and that a such a short "build season" is a good use of our time? 
Hey <!channel> there are only five responses on the survey! This is your chance to have a say in what we are working on in the preseason, so make sure to fill it out ASAP!
I swear that is the same url but now it works
Ta-da! <https://goo.gl/forms/AQ0OiEIilEePkju13>
Idk where it went wrong
Sorry trying to fix it
try harder
404 not found
Okay, nvm, here's the survey! Everyone needs to fill it out by the NEXT MEETING so that we can move forward with our mock build season. Please make an informed decision.

Anyone remember cons on logomotion?
<!channel> Head's up before too many people go to bed: Survey coming regarding mock build season in next half hour
Design meeting starting at 6:50 in conference room! <!channel> 
ok that would be a lot to let them know of at once lol
Idk about Smith, Wilson is
And is Mr. Smith?
Is Wilson aware of the mock build season?
Once the numbers are in place for how preseason hours correspond to two weeks of build season, then comes the explanation of mentor support and the importance of everyone cading in the same room and taking the time to get this project right so we don't screw up real build season
Yeah, I know. But as support for why we need more time. Why is Wilson's favorite question
just showing them a calendar as to why isn't probably going to cut it
no need to convince me, I'm just trying to figure out how to allow it to appeal to Wilson and/or Mr. Smith to make it happen
Well both
Sorry preseason
The point of build season is to learn, and the best way to do that is thru the mentors
Yeah, of course. Any help we could get would be great so we can make sure our designs are good
I don't think the entire team would be able to make an extra meeting, so I'm kinda going off the assumption it would be design + others (maybe)
Your own
You mean from other subteams or from our own?
do you guys need other mentor support at the extra meetings?
my bad
well there we go
oh
I'll buy into it. 
Into more meetings
Into what? A calendar?
I doubt the mentors will buy into that tbh
I'll develop a calendar to show to her to make a case for more meetings
Yeah, I mean if the students voice's matter...
We could meet in between school and robots, but that cuts into dinner and homework time. Idk how we will get Wilson to let us come in an extra day if she won't let us stay till 8:30, but we should def push for that
We should also start looking to add in the extra time we missed, whether we work out of school more, or we come in on Wednesdays or something like that. Probably discuss this on Thursday.
Yes
<!channel> I'm thinking Thursday is the day to choose our competition and set ground rules, meaning people should come to the meeting with at least a vague understanding about what each previous game was about so we can choose. Does that sound right?

I would note that I think they should be encouraged to do most of this outside of robotics meetings so that time in meetings can be spent in some sort of shadowing situation with older students working on the mock build season
Yes, I like that idea
yeah an end date with a recommended pace to get the chapters done in that timeframe 
That's a good idea, I just thought 2 chapters a week might be a good basis because they all might be at different chapters in the book
Putting an end date on when they should have it done would be my choice, but do what ever you think is best
I agree but I also think it's important to have assignments and a timeline. The book can be a bit more flexible 
Yes 
I'd say not requiring certain chapters a week would be best so they don't feel like the have a massive commitment on top of everything, how little it may be.
Does that sound ok?
do we have their emails though?
Ok, I can do a rough draft email and let you all check it then I will try to send it by 8 tonight
This is <@U1F0P4FA5>, I think 2 chapters a week is fine
2 chapters a week isn’t too bad if they also work on it during robotics meetings
What would you say is a reasonable workload for them regarding the book?
I mean I don't really have a say, but I'd say go ahead.
For example, "try to do 2 chapters a week" or something
I also think it might be a good idea to implement a timeline 
i totally agree
I know I just think it's a good idea to send a follow up email to make sure they stay on track.
I just think that it would be a good idea to send them an email saying "hey this is how you can continue to work on the book while we figure stuff out further"
I know some of them have been working at home
Getting them on the book could just buy us some time to get stuff done
Oh no I totally agree with that
But I think having more stuff for them to do after the book also needs to get done
I think that's going to have to happen, as I see it, they have no direction on anything going forward.
Tucker- I think it might be a good idea to remind the Freshman on Design that they are able to get Autodesk installed on their computers and they should continue to be working on the book while meetings are not in session. Do you think an email should be sent out? I would be happy to do so
The library is in the a360 under part's library -&gt; Skunk Part's library
Hey guys so I've started working on the parts library in A360, which got me thinking, It's October 15th and because of the stuff that's been going on we haven't been able to work on any projects at all. I think we all need to have a meeting at some point soon to discuss and consolidate a path forward for the design team. Getting back on track with the mock-build season and figuring out a plan to teach the freshman is the main things that we need to get done. If we decide that it's too late to the the mock-build season, coming up with a new plan of action is going to be paramount. Looping back to the library, I've found that vex put all their gears into a nice folder, except they are all named with the part numbers, not the names of what they are, I.E "217-5893" -&gt; "82 Tooth 1/2 Inch Hex Gear". I think If people could help out with changing the names for right now that would be great. Also adding onto the library would be sweet.
Team I will not be able to make it for the next 2 weeks.  I am transitioning projects right now and it is taking up extra time.  
Hey <!channel>, so it looks like more regular preseason work will begin on Monday. I'm thinking the Fusion360 conversation will be pretty short, as will the prototyping conversation, but then we can get into the specifics of our design process for the mock build season. Just a heads-up so we can get back on schedule. Any thoughts?
Hey team I will not be able to make it to any of the meetings tonight.  I'm working late tonight.
yeah, true
Yeah, it can. It's probably better to do it sooner rather than later. It just probably won't be absolutely necessary until the mock build season begins
That's fair. I mean it isn't a big deal to ask Mr. McLaughlin to put inventor on your laptop tomorrow so it can be ready for next meeting
Good point... In the future I will suggest that we get Mr. McLaughlin to install Inventor on school laptops. Otherwise, Fusion360 has a in-browser platform. We shouldn't have to deal with that yet though because the mock build season isn't supposed to start until the second week of October. 
If the 4H meeting is being held out of school, how will some people get into preseason work without school desktops for CAD?
We have a location at the school if anyone wants to stick it out as well :wink:
No worries I'll be looking out for the official communication then.  That's too bad it played out like that. 
There are a few options going around
We are still working on that. I just did a survey among students to get an idea of how many people we need the location to be able to hold
Where is the 4h meeting being held? I haven't gotten an email on this yet.
Anyways, do you guys think it would be a good idea to have half an hour to an hour to get back into our preseason work?
Ok make that clear thanks 
Yeah, there are. I'm talking about the 4H meeting
There is
Is there not two separate meetings? 
Wdym 
Wait did I miss something? 
Hey <!channel>, I am wondering if you all think it will be worthwhile spending time at the meeting tomorrow doing subteam work. Based on our preseason calendar we should be having conversations about the design process and strategy we will use in our mock preseason
As an aside you all should be very proud about how you are handling this situation.  I have been very impressed with your professionalism and democracy.  Very well done.  
Their modeling is intended for preparing an imported model for analysis.  Such as defeaturing threads and other small stress concentrations.  Or splitting surfaces to apply loads in a particular area or region. Or simplifying a model by splitting it along symmetry lines.  It does not have some of the more advanced modeling features that inventor or solid works has.  This would be used to post process inventor models so that we could run more complicated fea on them.  
Looks like when you use Ansys it also comes with a new modeling program like inventor or solidworks called SpaceClaim
That would probably do the trick.  
<http://www.ansys.com/academic/free-student-products>
Looks like I lied, Ansys does have free stuff
We could ask for an educational discount?
Ooo Ansys. That's expensive software though.
Solid works uses a similar system that can probably only get us 88% aswell.  for some more advanced stuff we can look into getting Ansys or some other professional analysis software. In addition we can go over some of the more advanced mathematic solutions to common problems.  
Works
Solid
Really good math
Where should we get the other 20%?
I'll be working on some stress analysis stuff and see what inventor can help us do. It is pretty limited it seems in inventor.  However it can probably do 80% of what we need to do.  
Running a bit late ill be there at 630
Yeah its gonna be huge
Oh really?

Hi Nathan
<@U1F0W3FFC> has joined the group
Accuracy depends on a lot of input parameters, proper mesh type and sizing, proper fixturing, and loading. It's a semester long course in college. 
Stress test analysis in inventor is not very accurate, if you have Solidworks you should try it on there. I can help you with that after school if you want.

We'll find out later tho
Ohhh and do some math like how much force will be applied when it smashes into another robot going 10 ft/s
If you stress test it I can help explain the stress concentrations. 
Yo, that cheese is not bad. 
You should do some stress tests on that
Yeah it is! I love cheesing!

Yeah I remember.
Payvid and Anna have agreed too (correct me if I'm wrong)
Ok cool
Yeah I have that set up already
So tommorrow is just kids, we should probably have some people come in early to set up some cad models
Ok that makes sense
Yeah
The final check-in in December?
We haven't decided which specific day to have our final check-in, just which week. If we do that on the Tuesday instead of the Thursday, we could devote Thursday to splitting up the work and having the full design team compile the parts library (i.e. you have motors, she has pneumatics, he has bearings, washers, etc.)
So with that, should the parts library be moved to a home project (higher chance of not getting done) or should we spend a meeting doing that at some other point?
Now more than ever, learning fusion is very important.
Okay, as we will not be meeting until Thursday it would be good if people practice Fusion on their own, so we have some tiny amount of fusion knowledge before the new kids come on.
Top kek

Everyone will approach this with an open mind
Oh goodie
Okay <!channel> everyone should get fusion 360 installed on their laptops by next Tuesday because new kids aren't coming until Thursday, so we should use Tuesday as a CAD practice day
Yeah I get what you mean.
No, if we use google calendar I wanna organize it first. I'll probably try to put it in sheets or something tho (sheets is more fun)
That on a Google calendar yet?

Also <!channel> think about what to tell new kids about the team and about design 
<@U1JM7GF7E> The idea is that you guys come up with ideas. <@U1F0QEL0Z> You are going to need to define that a bit more clearly. Is the Dr. Pepper coming from a fridge? How does robot see fridge?
A robot that gives me Dr.pepper when ever I want
Give us ideas
I don't think quadcopters would be the most applicable to robots, but they could help your CAD skills
BAD WORDS
Nvm fuck quadcopters
Can we make quadcopters
<!channel> We should also consider how to incorporate cooperation between mechanical, electrical, and programming into our preseason projects. Even if it's just in CAD, we can at least consult with Davin on how our designs look from an electrical standpoint.
Okay <!channel> for the next meeting everyone should be thinking about preseason projects. Your project ideas should support following good design practices and learning cleaner CAD. Keep in mind we probably will not be able to build most projects, but it should still have some value. On Thursday we can then discuss what we want to do with our preseason and on what timeline.
Seems probably too lucrative for our team
I'm not sure
So where do we win it or make it?
It's about $1,000,000,000/gram so we might nit be able to buy it, but we can synthesize it with friendship and compassion.
How expensive is pure happiness? We need to budget for that.
I like it. Have you considered adding feet for added stability? Other than that you can fill out the form and get it reviewed by Franco and cut!
Pure happiness

<!channel> Hey everyone! Before the meeting today, you should all be thinking about what you want us to accomplish as a subteam this year.
Idk what you needed, but for the robot I would have just downloaded the assembly file, which has most of the other files included
Weird. I don't need it anymore but access is great if I can keep it. 
Just redownload it, it's really finniky sometimes it will work, sometimes not
The folder
The directory?
And in the alerts section it says "Downloading 100%..."
Tried to download the 2017 buildseason directory, it took a while and downloaded an empty download.zip file
ok
got the invite, thanks.
Cool.
it's all web based now
Do I need vault installed along with inventor or can I access it through a web client and download it that way?
just be careful when useing it
yes it does have that
Version control software
anyways, my dad is gonna have to approve you so hold on a bit
vcs?
Vcs right? Or similar?
ok, so I'm going to share you with the A360 drive (like google drive but for autodesk) you might need to make an account. It may just send you an email with a portal to view it, I can't remember which one it does.
<mailto:benevedeselias@gmail.com|benevedeselias@gmail.com>
<@U1F1ETJM7>
what is your email?
Autodesk Synthesis is holding an information session tomorrow that Davin and I are going to. Can I get a copy of the Autodesk inventor files from 2017? We're bringing code as well. 
Lucky for you the force calculation for that is the same your fluid is just different.  There are some other considerations (as it may be heavy to take all that hydralic fluid with you)
Oh yeah hydraulics will lift that no problem.  The stored  energy from high pressure pneumatic systems for that would start to get a little dicey.  
Yes, a large building, 8 m across, 12 from floor to top of ceiling
lol <@U1F0QEL0Z> 
Lit
something like this?
<@U1F0QEL0Z> uploaded a file: <https://skunkworksteam1983.slack.com/files/U1F0QEL0Z/F6GNT4M5H/mars_landscape_3d_model_fbx_obj_blend_mtl_220e7b37-3d60-430f-8a89-adcfc023cb32.png|mars_landscape_3d_model_fbx_obj_blend_mtl_220e7b37-3d60-430f-8a89-adcfc023cb32.png>
You can certainly use hydraulics for moving large buildings.  If we are talking skyscraper size then we have to talk about some serious tank treads
Like a large building? 

I'm imagining a Martian dome colony moving over rough terrain.... am I far off? 
I'm not sure, I've never worked with either before so I wouldn't know if the application would restrict the use of either
Can you use hydraulics? You will be able to get much higher forces out of hydraulics and it will be much safer.
I was looking at Martian habitats. The pneumatics-swerve had been used on the fairly large pressurized Martian rovers designed by NASA, but this would be much larger than those
a truck?
Okay, thanks for the help! <@U5BS3Q282> As it turns out, project I was working on was larger than a car
Also to give you an idea you can lift some crazy high loads with pneumatics and hydraulics. I use pneumatics to actuate valves at anywhere from 2000psi to 200psi.  It all just depends on what pressure your system can operate at.  Because of the low pressures for robotics your forces are limited by the size of the piston required.  For instance at 200psig (I think this is the limit for robots...) you need a piston diameter of 2.52in to give you 1000lbf.  Unless your designing a robot the size of a car that's probably enough to do whatever you want. 
Solid works is awesome everything you need and nothing you don't.

 <@U1F0P4FA5> I saw you were working on some pneumatics for rough terrain.  <http://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/pneumatic-cylinder-force-d_1273.html>

There is a link to a quick guide for calculating pneumatic forces on pistons.  I'm not sure exactly what your application is but you may consider looking into passive suspensions.  Active suspension  like what your talking about is super cool. <https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_suspension>

However passive suspensions can get the job done if you are looking to move fast over bumps.

What ever you decide like Tucker pointed out the swerving part has to happen either before the suspension so the whole suspension swerves or after the suspension so the wheels swerve on the end of the suspension.  

Looks like a cool concept! Good luck!
Okay cool
so yeah, it seems to work fine
I installed it in one install
That's interesting. So we can download both, we just have to run it twice?
like making a lego book, but for your parts, so someone can build and manufacture your stuff
it's for making documentation and books for parts and tools
I'm not sure, I think it's more of a "WOW LOOK AT OUR FEATURES", but it might be useful
I'm currently using the CAD serial number, but what's composer?
Oh awesome! (I'm a little l8 to the party, but it's exciting to hear we will be able to learn more advanced software.)
Same
I've been using solidworks for a while now if people have questions. 
Ok thanks
Your name is on the shared list.
Am I shared with it? I thought I was
It's in the design team folder now... solidworks codes
Ok thank you
I'll put the email with all of the instructions and codes in the gdrive 
Can you send your dads email please. I don't have it
Yo that's whats up
Hey guys, so before the end of the season I talked to coach about getting setup with the free licences of solidworks for our team. They sent us a code for 10 licences so we can now start using solid works. Probably only be useing it for personal use, and not during build season, but it's a cool tool to have access to. If you are interested email or text my dad and he can get you that info.
<https://youtu.be/ZJKDY4tc3-s>
It depends on the region where the drive base has to operate... That may be a little bit of an unknown, and the area might be flat but tilted itself
You could also look into a suspension system on just the wheels, not the whole module, if the changes you're trying to take up are relatively small. 
Payton hit the nail on the head. 
Just remember, it working pressure multiplied by cross sectional area. If you write it out with the units you'll see how they cancel and give you force. 
I think that helps a bit
Thanks Payton for the maths
Oh that's pretty close to what I need 
<@U1F0QEL0Z> uploaded a file: <https://skunkworksteam1983.slack.com/files/U1F0QEL0Z/F6DMG4GD8/081029-chariot-module-02.jpg|081029-chariot-module-02.jpg> and commented: Like this
What if you just rotate around the piston
Diameter of the cylinder squared times the psi of whatever tank your using. In our case it is 200 psi compressor. So basically if you had a 2 in diameter then you would square it so 4 then multiply by 200psi so 800 lbs of lifting for that one cylinder 
You can't do that style of lift with a coaxial swerve module. 
Yeah 
Payton can help you size some cylinders though. 
Just gotta expand the base
So you can make the design they did with pnumatics, but you have to take a lot of care with how you are supporting and powering the swerve.
That would be a bad day
Minus the falling over
Tucker with the relic. 
Like that?
<https://youtu.be/5MgdGtwQQIo>
You said uneven terrain. So you make your adjustments, then lock in, then what happens next? 
What do you mean?
What happens once you start moving and the terrain changes? 
No I don't
So variable pitch
To calc the diameter you'll need for the cylinder
I'm not sure... I basically want to make a drive base level on really uneven terrain then have it lock in place
Are you trying to do continuously variable adjustments, or discreet? 
For the weight?
Do you know the calculations 
Idk if it's possible to lift that much weight...
Very
Um....
Um ok so how heavy
It's not a robots project
I want to adjust the amount these wheels drop under a swerve drive base
What are you trying to accomplish? 


Hey, I was wondering if I could get some help with pneumatics. I haven't used them before, so I have no idea where to start
I'm not doing a summer project, I'm too busy with my internship.
Possibly, I haven't started on a single thing in cad yet, so I'm not sure. I am sure that if I just work on it and burn it out, it can get into assembly before school.
Cool, do you think you will get to an assembly phase before school starts?
Hey, I just wanted to check in with how people are doing with summer projects. I feel like we haven't talked in a while. I'm done with my background reaserch, starting to work on doing some preliminary cad work for my swerve drive. Haven't talked to programming yet, so I'll have to do that at some point. I'll post my background research later (driving right now) if anyone wants to look at it.
Good notebook skills are highly marketable.  It is a good habit to start early.  You'll need it for your professional careers. Good engineers and scientists keep every detail recorded somewhere. So that when you need to know what mine in Africa that titanium that failed came from you have that somewhere.  It sounds silly but someday you'll know what I'm talking about. 
Yeah engineering notebooks are great no matter what tool you guys use.  It should track every idea, decision, equations, sources for info, cad concepts, concept sketches, etc.  You never know what details will become important in a project. It is important to write it all down somewhere so that someone else can trace your steps.
I feel it. 
I think I'll start tracking in September then, and if people choose to continue CAD projects from the summer into robotics season then they can show what they did over the summer
You made a good point about them being personal projects. 
Don't let me dictate what you do dooder. I'm just giving my opinion, you get to call the shots. 
I could make a spreadsheet in the Google drive and ask people to self-report their projects
Yeah, I think so.
When in actuality, a lot could be happening without a proposal ever being submitted. 
I think that it may appear like no work is being done later on if you don't get many proposals, you know what I mean? 
I hadn't planned on tracking those since they are somewhere in between robotics project and personal project. I suppose they would need to be tracked if that is what people are using for their fall preseason projects tho
I guess I would ask how, or if, you plan to keep up with pure cad projects? Since they'll never be proposed for prototyping. 
I can follow your logic there. 
Well I was thinking that once a proposal gets turned in it is very clear that it is an official project, not just an idea, and it is easier to track because in order to get that proposal approved other people have to be notified
grandmasterizzie: I think it just depends on when you want to start tracking. I don't think it's inherently better to start after a prototyping proposal compared to initial investigation, or vice versa. 
Yeah, that's pretty much where we are right now. I could just ask people on slack and then compile a spreadsheet from there, but that'll probably miss a couple of people who don't check it regularly
grandmasterizzie: I feel it yo. I guess what I was after was a one stop shop if I wanted to check in on what people were working on. Right now I feel like the only way to know is to ask everyone individually. 
Okay cool
Yeah, I just made an account. I'll ask you for any more info I need, I think I'll just wait until I get to that point.
Well, if you go to <http://overleaf.com|overleaf.com> you could try to sign in. In the past I just shared the documents with people using a link, so u may have not created an account
I remember using it, I just don't have any of the log-in information for that, or any idea of how to get to it.
It uses latex
<@U1F0QEL0Z> It's the documentation website we used during build season. When people are ready for documentation I can create a template
Not too sure if that was meant for build season, or if it could be adapted to prototyping
I'm not too familiar with Overleaf, So If you could DM me some info on that, that would be great. I just looked in the google drive and saw the "documentation guidelines" Doc
Well, once people start prototyping they can record results and the initial steps of the project in Overleaf, like we've done in the past. These files can be exported to PDFs after project completion and accumulated somewhere, along with the engineering notebooks from the past two years. Where, I don't know yet. It could be a360 or the google drive
Kind of, I think the initial aspect of it was to make sure people knew what they were doing without willy nilly going in and hacking things together. I'm sure we can make it so that we track them through the process. I know we have a design review checklist that is also in the google drive. We also talked about writing down stuff in an engineering journal through A360, but I'm not too sure how far along we are with that.
So the intent is to initiate tracking once prototype proposal has been submitted?
As far as I know, no projects have been officially proposed yet. Everyone's still doing initial paperwork
not yet
Is there a spreadsheet or something tracking proposed projects and their owners/status?

Excellent that sounds like a good plan.  I am excited to see what the team comes up with this summer.  Thanks for the update
we have the systems in place to start creating a schedule, we've decided that we aren't going to be building a new robot from the ground up, but instead going to looking into more designs to make the current robot better. We have a prototype check-list that every student has to fill out if they want to start creating something that they have been researching. We also talked about what we are doing for pre-season next year. Izzie can probably fill you in on any questions you have. I think I might have missed something. so someone correct or confirm what I have said. <@U1F0P4FA5> <@U5BS3Q282>
Just got back from vacation.  Looks like you guys have been busy.  Have plans for the summer fleshed out? And are you guys still meeting Tuesdays and Thursdays?

They should probably have designs in CAD, but the designs don't need to pass through a peer review and they don't need to be cheesed or integrated with anything else
To what level do you anticipate prototypes to be "designed" prior to proposal? 
I would say that some rough geometry should be created before prototyping so that the prototypes are realistic with whatever space the eventual design has, but a more strict master geometry would come after experimentation, before a more final design
When would rough CAD, like geometry, fit into the timeline with regard to the prototyping proposal? 
Thanks.

Awesome, thank you!
Anyone who wants to do a summer project: there are now project proposal forms in the google drive folder. One is for prototyping, and one is for final assembly. Summer meetings will not happen without this completed, as it proves that you have gone through the initial phases of the vex engineering design process
I mean like the very first thing to show what your idea is before you build anything, and when your ready to make the proof of concept then you design it with wood. I guess that first step is optional
Then it does have to be designed in wood
This could probably be done by having more than one sketch for the master robot geometry
uribe0areo: ye
Wouldn't that first prototype just be the proof of concept?
<@U1F0QEL0Z> what do you mean? Wouldn't it just be 30 (if u r looking at it exactly)
<http://curriculum.vexrobotics.com/curriculum/intro-to-engineering/what-is-the-engineering-design-process>
For people who are interested, here are the links to the NASA Systems Engineering Handbook and the Vex Engineering Design Process: <https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/atoms/files/nasa_systems_engineering_handbook.pdf>
uribe0areo: uribe0areo:  We need to look at how one specific part works along with how it works with the other robot components as well as alone. For example: the turret worked okay on its own but when put in the assembly we realized it had to be moved over because the Bento Box was in the way and it wouldn't have a full 180 degrees of motion.
uribe0areo: This should include the paperwork that Izzie is working on along with a presentation (design review) that ensures that the designer of the part/assembly has made design decisions that are backed up by quantitative data instead of the qualitative data.
It's also critical to think about the why in the context of the previous meta/rules. How/What is easy to glean, the why takes much more digging.
uribe0areo: Design a full wooden prototype that includes components such as bearings and it will probably be powered by hand drills, keep in mind it will evolve into a sheet metal prototype
Another way to explore is to research past robots, such as 2006, to see what past winners did, and think about how you can take that idea or concept and apply it to this year's game to create your own idea.
uribe0areo: Designing your initial proof of concept doesn't have to be designed in wood, but keep in mind your first prototype has to be in wood to test the proof of concept.
On the fly communication
I'd ask Bella about it, but I don't know how lights would convey any more information than is already conveyed in driver's meetings
It's something that we have to understand as part of the problem, not directly important, but something to think about when designing. Maybe light signals to alert other teams? 
Okay. Idk if this will be a part of the problem addressed by robot updates tho
All of those things, there was a match at worlds where us and our alliance partner were fighting over a gear on the ground. If we establish quick methods of communicating with other teams for that situation, It can easily be established for the rest. The rest being lanes, placeing of gears, and retrieval stations. We already do this before matches, but we need to look into simplifying and adapting this so that it works a majority of the time, or at least more so then it does now.
What do you mean by which gear? Which lift? Which retrieval station?
One main thing we need to do is communicate with the other teams in our alliance on who is going for which gear during the match.
Okay. So first part of problem definition is we need a guaranteed ranking point. Do we need to add anything in about gears? We are pretty good when the robot doesn't break down
One thing that we could explore is the exact amount of balls that we need to get from the hopper on top of our load to get the 40 kpa. This should also include equations for accuracy.
And the best way to do that is in auto
To say the obvious, we need to get a ranking point every match. 
uribe0areo: So what are we thinking for our problem? Generally our robot does not score enough match/ranking points

I see
You can slam shift those without much concern. 
Yup. Dog gears. 
So those are like the shifters on slippery?
I'm looking it up now
Do you know what I'm talking about? 
For FRC you just use a dog gear. 
I guess I haven't looked at a clutch yet
You manually​ get the shafts close by changing RPM l, then the clutch does the rest. 
Ok
A synchronizing mechanism would be a clutch of sorts the brought the two shafts to similar speed before transfering power completely. Like in a manual transmission is a car. 
Would you have both sets of gear move while they are both spinning?
Because I've actually been thinking of that exact thing in my head. What are the synchronizing mechanisms?
And yes Tucker. It's why you use a dog gear for FRC. More robust without a synchronizing mechanism. 
Properly utilizing a PTO requires a lot of foresight and a truly integrated design. I'd say it is most certainly non-trivial to properly implement. 
Don't you run into problems when shifting with that? Gear not being alighed while for is being applied
Yeah that's cool

That's really cool, and something we should keep in mind with the chezy champs robot.
Here's a simple one with a sliding shifter shaft and multiple gear ratios. 
It allows you to use one power source for multiple outputs. 
A simple PTO can work just like a two speed transmission. With the dog engaged on one side one mechanism, shift the dog gear to the other side and drive the other mechanism. 
Kind of, I would like to know more though
Do you know how a two speed shifter with a dog gear works? 
I know what it is, I don't really know how it works/ how to make one
Do you know how a PTO works?

Are there any more teams that do stuff like this, I think combining different videos to make a plan for the new kids would be good.
Snap rings are not that great IMO. They can fail pretty easily if put in poor loading conditions.
Ok
Very similar.
you can check out e-clips too.
It's interesting
One thing I was thinking we could use snap rings is not on the ends of shafts, but in the middle for spacing
Pretty much the only good thing about hex bearings is that you can put a hex shaft through them. :stuck_out_tongue:
Hex bearings are not that dope.
They also tended to make the ends of the shafts rounds, and not use hex bearing, why do you think they would do that
but yah. I like our solution.
groove*
I would think our solution is a bit more robust and easier to make
Yeah thats how they were doing it
I think our solution is more robust, but I would have to look at theirs again.
You turn a small grove into the shaft and then push the snap ring over. Since the ID of the ring is smaller than that of the shaft, it stays in the grove.
Snap ring uses a grove on the shaft iirc.
Hey dave, so I was watching those videos, and he was talking about the shafts for a west coast drive, we use a bolt that screws into the shaft instead of what they use (a snap ring) what is the benefits of either?
They are pretty solid. 
I will in a bit

I can Skype or TeamSpeak if you want to talk more about these details while I CAD,
yeah I am
David are you at home?
Ok
One sec, I can CAD up an example.
So cheese it like squares then extrapolate the triangles from them?
The way you get to triangles is by making squares first, with sides parallel to the desired diagonals, and then connecting the square across the center, bisecting it into to isosceles triangles.
No, I was a big proponent of triangles
And triangles are fine Tucker.
Sometimes having those diagonals is not feasible, due to other geometry, or a weird resulting truss pattern, but that kinda thing is what you should shoot for.
Ok, so either don't use triangles, or make the triangles into hexagons first
That makes sense
Ideally, you want a straight line of members connecting the opposing corners. That way, when the frame tries to turn into a diamond (I usually call this "parallelograming") one of the lines acts in tension, and the other compression.
Exactly.
Yeah, and the joints not being linear would allow that to happen 
The belly pan being designed to take up shear forces and turn them into tensile and compression loads is what helps prevent the rectangular drive base from becoming a rhombus.
The objective of the belly pan is nuanced, but one of the chief objectives is to provide rigidity and resistance to shearing forces across the drive rails.
Can't really draw it because I'm on the phone
That's close. If the truss members are not co-linear a bending moment will be created at each joint if a force is applied along the axis of the first member.
Doesn't it just make the joints where they all come together have forces from all side being tension compression. And torque being applied from a vertical perspective?
Think about what Franco said about axial stresses on Thursday.
Why were they only experiencing those two?
Yup.
yeah tension and compression
Remember when we drew the bridge truss on the board? Each member of the truss only was experiencing one of two forces, or you remember what those forces were?
Not 100% sure but maybe the joint is being twisted? or is that sheer force?
Kinda? Why do you think that it is torsion? What is being twisted?
Does it create torsion at the connection point creating weakness?
Why is that bad?
Bingo.
That the struts are not co-linear and instead keep offsetting?
Elaborate, I think you are on the right track.
That the struts are all leading to two points instead of one?
Nope.
Is it the elongated shape of the shape where the struts connect? 
Izzie?
Tucker do you see it?
What's the other half.
That's half of it.
That'
Is it that the strusses aren't the same width?
Yes, they induced significant stress concentrations. I'm looking for something more subtle though.
The four cuts along the perimeter of the base...aren't those significant weak points? 
There is some dope stuff here, but also some not so dope stuff.
Anyone want to talk about this truss pattern that Payton used on his H-Drive?

Thanks Tucker, can anyone corroborate these are in the correct order?
Shooting 1 climbing 2 gears 3 drive train 4

You feel me?
3.
2.
1.
What about in descending numerical order?
Gears we didnt talk about too much
I don't have the exact ones, but I think the most we got was shooting, didnt have real numbers, maybe 5 balls per second. Drive train we said we wanted to go 12 feet/second and climbing we wanted to be able to climb in 4-5 seconds
Ill check
Does someone have the KPP's in order of importance?
So Payton and I talked for a little bit about what the priorities are for this design, but it seemed a bit hazy in some aspects.
Then last year
Just making sure
More so
Will be considered
Not even close to that
I don't know where we are in the design process but id like to remind that there should be more space this time for the Rio and peripherals (navx), and on a more stable platform
You have the vertical conveyor for the shooter vertical, try making it at a shallow angle towards the back of the robot.
I think. I'm not sure exactly what you mean tho 
Would that help make the hopper a bit bigger?
It doesn't?
Why does the wall behind the shooter for the balls to roll up have to be vertical?

Hey Dave what's your gmail?
Hey, if everyone could figure out really quickly the exact dates that they will be unavailable this summer, that would be great
*power curves*
That's something we have been working on with these prototypes. I know that in my group we are using real motors and handing it over to programmers, but we haven't looked too much into what gearbox should be used
I think that we should start to differentiate between a proof of concept and a prototype. A prototype should be representative of a mechanism that could go onto a robot with some refinement. IMHO prototypes should use the actual motor and a representative gearbox for the application. Spinning things with a drill is proof of concept level. The more refined the prototype, the better the data it will yield. 
I think the idea with the geometry was that while it is necessary to do some basic sketches for prototyping to make the prototypes accurate, the actual master geometry would come at the beginning of the design phase
BTW... 254, 118, 33 and many other teams make their younger members go through this same vex curriculum... just like we started to do last year.
Chiming in here... don't forget that a primary goal with this project is to establish an engineering design process that can be used during build season and beyond. I see Dave's inquiries as trying to see what steps you are taking in this process... the process that was taught to the Freshman and current Sophmores is a great starting point. They have to prove they fully understand it with a presentation just to make it on the FRC team. Current Juniors should learn it too. If everyone is following the same process, communication goes so much better. With a few modifications, it can be used effectively for this project. Like it was said in class... We can make iterations to our process from project to project to make it better. Add in some sound engineering practices and you guys should be able to make some killer robots every time. <http://curriculum.vexrobotics.com> look at section 1.3. Don't let the cool factor of what you are doing get in the way of good engineering design processes and practices.
Okok, that sounds more like what I hoped you be after. 
and eliminated a design that was too large
We sketched out the sizes of other pieces to make sure it would fit
I think our prototypes are focused with adjustability in mind
Oh, I understand. Our geometry has been constrained to fit in the robot volume, leaving room for other components
I understand having the two separate groups, I can follow the thinking there. What I'm concerned about is that prototyping may lose value if the prototypes are not built with realistic constraints. 
Since we are including a drive base and gear collector 
I believe our team may need more master geometry than we have at the moment, I'll talk to my team about that 
The two prototyping groups' geometries don't match up because they are for significantly different robots. We will be making a final geometry once we have decided which mechanisms we are using
That's good, I think that shows improving communication. What about in CAD though? No working geometry is a little concerning, that is how problems started last year. 
Well, we have the design team in two separate groups, but we have been updating each other constantly and providing feedback
Independent from one another. In a void. 
What do you mean by in a vacuum?
Are your prototypes being developed in vacuum? I guess what I'm after is what steps you're taking to mitigate the integration problems that cropped up last season. 
too
yeah that to
My team is working on talking with programming and electrical closely so that they are integrated in the design so they can have what they want, and also we're talking very close to each other so we know what the others are doing.
We have discussed Kirby's idea for a new way of doing the master geometry, but we haven't come up with a definite plan
I think that that is a good goal, did you discuss how you're going to achieve it? 
We discussed how we didn't do system integration that well last year, so we want to try to do it better for this bot
Not much. To the extent that we know we want systems to be better integrated
When you guys had the discussion about last year's robot, did you discuss system integration?
And also yeah we're going to probably build the drivetrain that Payton made and test it to see if it is useful for this year's game
Payvid is David and Payton btw
In the original meeting we wanted to keep most of the drive base the same, but I understand Payvid has made another drive base design
What about the drivetrain? 
The climber is probably going to be the most similar component between the original bot and the superbot. The shooter will be similar if we go with a turret, but it will be iterated on. If we go with a double shooter, it will be entirely new
We had a discussion about what happened with this year's robot, and some designs are being iterated on for the new robots
Is there a post mortem being done on the robot design from this year? Is that design being iterated on at all? 
At the moment, we are prototyping two different robots, which is why design team is halved. One team is designing around making a double fixed shooter, one around a turret.
Sorry for being a bit behind, I got home a few weeks ago and have been getting started at work. Could some one bring me up to speed on what's going on? 
We talked about it in a group
For ours, based off size of fuel and robot volume
How is the geometry for the prototypes being determined? 
There's a general 3D model master geometry for ours but it's not super accurate at the moment, it needs to be updated if we want to use it
There are sketches in random places, but it's all for prototyping purposes, with nothing final
Right now we are in the prototyping phase
Is there new master geometry for the "super robot" ? I've not been on A360 in a while. 
Ah@
We can use it now. Last night inventor wouldn't open on desktop computers
Opening?
Breaking news: autodesk inventor opening in fifth period CAD class. Robotics students should be able to use it tomorrow at robotics meeting.
Cool!
Haha I expect some sharing to happen.  I hope to cover all the basics of these subjects  as well as CAD and FEA before the season starts next year over the summer and during the pre season.  
And also thanks Franko!
Awesome! Thank you very much

Machineries handbook is good for a general explanation of a topic.  It has standard geometry and accepted mechanism equations.

Mechanical engineering design is good for a more in-depth study of mechanisms

Dynamics is good for making dynamic models of forces and positions in rigid body systems.

Mechanics of materials is an introduction to stress analysis using hand calculations

Statics Is an introduction to static structural loads determining reaction loads and loads in trusses

Materials Science is and introduction to materials science you guys probably only care about the chapters on mechanical properties but there is some other interesting stuff there too.

This is specifically why he puts individual licenses on laptops, but it should be up by sometime today apparently
You can get a free student license for a personal laptop online 
Can he get the licenses on laptops? It's late in the year, but laptops still work for inventor, and anyone with a personal computer should be able to get an educational license
Cool thanks, I'm talking to McLaughlin rn about the desktop computers. It may not be something he can fix because the server is district wide
Let me know if you think there should be a change
Here's a link to the documentation outline for prototyping (as requested)!
<https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xafAsY5wWT9Ku762NQkulOqanvwRlnoJCFtExcmLQV0/edit?usp=sharing>
The original deadline, the drivebase will be done and tested, the gear collector will be assembled and at least started testing, and shooter will probably be close to be done, but I'm being really conservative about my estimates and being the devil's advocate
What about by the original deadline? I'm still not entirely sure when robotics ends
Oh yeah, I don't think it's impossible, but if we do have the materials then by that time we'll probably be in the testing phase 
I thought we didn't have enough materials for the drive base
The drive base might be ready for testing, gear collector is probably going to get to assembly by then, and I don't know about the shooter, probably in the final designing phase to assure reliability. David can talk about the extendable hopper and ball collector.
What about assembly and testing? Prototype-level
Preliminary design work will most likely be done by then. If the desktop computers aren't going to work for more than today then that might mess stuff up
So I'm not sure, but I've been hearing that the last meeting is either Thursday or next Thursday, meaning we can't do the PDR on June 8. Do people think they could have data and documentation before June 1? At least preliminary stuff
Tucker is no longer in our group, and Dave and Franko looked at Payton's drive base, and that's all I can say with certainty, but Payton and David did some more work on their jobs.
Redesign and integration of the drive base sides making everything compact. Soon working to get the hopper to be part of that  
Henry continued design work on the roller floor with the thought of integrating with the drive base, he also worked a bit on the gear collector, and he's thinking about electronics to go underneath the roller floor
Well, what do u know about what they got done?
For our half, I worked on designing a prototype gear collector that collects from the top and also the floor. I also started initial design work on the shooter. I can talk for Payton, David, and Henry if they want
Okay, so what got done today? I know that for the prototurret we attached the snowflake to an axle in the middle of our hopper base, raised the hopper base to leave space for a motor, designed a motor mount, and proceeded on cading out how motor mounts would work on an actual design.
Nvm, got it
Anyone not doing anything?
With the hopper structure, we have the circular base cut out and the top of the the rectangular section. We have the snowflake which would go in the circular base, and plan on attaching motors on Tuesday. 
<@U1F0GLE9M>  Yeah I've had to redo a lot of stuff because I haven't so that's always a first when I can. 
<@U2A68KU8K>  Make sure you constrain things to the origin or origin planes whenever you can
Yeah I agree, we'll work on it, maybe tomorrow I can create some Google docs for us to document what progress each person did that day 
Angelina and issac are mainly working on that 
<@U1F0GLE9M> I know the feeling after making the Hdrive. Deleted one piece and didn't have a robot 
Work in progress
<@U1F0KHF71> Where did we get with the hopper structure?
Well you need a lot of time for data collection in a lot of different areas.
Yup, I mean we have Henry the Data Dude who will help with documentation and incorporating the data
Exactly that
We have one prototype cut out and ready to be put together and tested by Tuesday (if all goes well)
Also keep in mind that since you guys are taking on more prototypes, you will need to do a lot more testing, and handle a lot more documentation
Ye tru
Same tho
Ah
Yeah I meant after cad if necessary for assembly 
I don't need extra meetings, I need more time out of school with my Computer
If necessary we could try to meet extra days to meet the deadline. Coming in for extra time should probably start to be normal for design/build anyway
How long do you guys estimate for assembly? We have 5 meetings left, at least one of which should be for docs and at least one for data collection
Noice af
Also climber
Hood will be done, feeding needs to be integrated
<@U1F0GLE9M> uploaded a file: <https://skunkworksteam1983.slack.com/files/U1F0GLE9M/F5FDLS7DY/image_uploaded_from_ios.jpg|FloorCollector.stonetablet>
Cool, including the motorized hood and feeding mechanism?
I plan to start integrating the shooter next week (includes getting it down by then)

Also Henry started some initial CAD for the floor roller, he found some materials he wanted to get for it
:letterm2: :lettere2: :lettere: :letterm: :lettere2: :letterd: 
:checkem: 
Yeah that'd be good Payton, and I also started some work on a gear collector from the floor and from the station but the geometry didn't work so I'll have to rethink it
Yeah. I know I don't have all holes put in and the pneumatics shown aren't the correct ones. If anyone wants to mark up and make notes of what I have now it would be helpful to get a fresh set of eyes on it. 
okay so a preliminary design review on Tuesday for the H-drive?
The drive base will hopefully be done by then so I'll run it through you guys for nit picking then bowlin 
Working on extending hopper and ball collector. I'll work on it this weekend and try to finish it up by Tuesday
Also, what do you guys plan to do next time <!channel> 
Started fixed shooter 
Drop colson H-drive on A360. Almost done just needs pneumatics and talon placement 
Hey, so can we get another update? At least one representative from each prototyping group please
<@U5BS3Q282> I invited you to A360 with the email you sent me. 
What is your email?
Awesome work guys! Im sorry I didnt stop by I got stuck in a parent meeting but it sounds like you guys didn't miss me. Could I get invited to the A360 project to see what you guys have been working on?
Its hard to explain without pictures but I can upload it later if need be
Between Harrison and I, we got done several iterations of the shape of the spiny pieces. We have 4 different designs that hold 6, 7, 8, and 9 balls as well as one design that has the cone incorporated in it with plans of making each out of different materials. I think that's something like 5-6 different designs? I also made one that has a different shape at the end.
Hey, can we all do quick status updates? Today the turret group did a basic master geometry, caded the center spinny pieces for the bottom of the hopper, caded some potential center cone shapes, and began constructing the basic hopper structure.
<!channel> 
Quick reminder...remember to bring your white game shirts along with your reflection tomorrow night
<!channel> Everyone working on prototypes, PLEASE make a folder in A360 with everything that you have already for your group, you can do that in the "2017 post season projects" folder. I'm fairly sure that A360 can take any file format, which is really helpful when you have projects like this. Thanks.

PS Take pictures
Exactamente
good idea which will also ensure that we document our process as we are prototyping
If we are presenting we should also have at least started documentation so that we have already put our prototype explanations into words before trying to explain to everyone else.
Si senior
well we want to get clear quantitative data to make an informed decision so have our prototype needs to be completely built and the results recorded
Yeah I know, I want to talk to them about what we want to get done by then, who's going to do what, and where we want to be when we finish 
That's like 7 meetings
Hmm I'll have to discuss that with my group
and we want to finish prototypes before the summer
Yeah, because we only have two school-year meetings after that
Oh you mean after the prototypes are finished and tested?
Probably also a group discussion about the results of each prototype, since some prototypes won't progress to the full design phase
yeah that works Victor
Sounds good. let's set that as a tentative date and work towards that. and maybe a quick powerpoint presentation with results??
Probably a full presentation and explanation on literally everything we plan to do and why we plan to do that.
What does a full pdr entail?
Hey, what do people think about doing a PDR (Preliminary Design Review) for the prototypes on June 8?

Keep working on floor pickup bb
Not really 
Is there anything that needs to be done tonight?
I think we might be able to get away with leaving the turret in the hopper 
Okay. I think its worked well have a bunch of people cutter the parts, just needs to be a bit more organized 
There's the spinner again
Ideally we'd be able to work in complete parallel i.e. team A works on the assembly of the comp bot and team B works on hopper v2 via the practice bot
<https://www.youtube.com/shared?ci=m1JF9nm7BSg>
Hey didya guys see this
Yeah
I was also planning on also including Kirby's piece since it was nearly ready to go today. 
Don't think so at this time
I'm gonna spend maybe two-three before going to robots in order to make some of those changes to the curve, the supports, and the ramp. Is there anything else major that should be edited?
I feel quite strongly that the assembly not being properly really hindered the hopper's performance
Don't know if there's gonna be enough time to do all the assembly, code deployment, and that though
I won't be able to make it during the day tomorrow but I really think we should TRY to make hopper v2 and see if the iterative improvements made any difference
Oh actually the preview is not done generating so just wait 
Yeah :sleepy:
Gotta pack and go Benton 
Yeah, but its blank and wont show the model
Can you open it at all? 
It looks like it didnt upload correctly to A360
Haha well done waking up early to do this

The idea is that the selected representative is the most approved nominee, not necessarily the majority's #1 choice
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Approval_voting>
1. We only vote on people who have been nominated/have self nominated
2. Everybody gets to vote for as many people as they want, but only once for each nominee
3. The person with the most votes is elected; as they are the person that the most people would be comfortable with as the nominee
4. If there's a tie for 1st, the vote is redone with only the nominees who had the most votes the first time around, again voting for as many as each pleases.
Eli you only put it in the seniors 
Lemme repost it here
My bad I had posted that in a different channel
What voting system did you propose?
Just a heads up; If I understand correctly the voting system I proposed is going to be the default used for other groups in the team as well
Both teams are at school on Tuesday 
4-H not done, but no 4-H meeting 
or 5I
It's I-5
what?
shit nice 
4H is done dude. We've moved on to 5H
._.
but where's 4h meeting 
right 
"that we have reached an agreement,"
there’s one meeting
Do we know if discussion of the progress made will be all that's done at the meeting tues? Or will we have time for preseason projects etc
Just 1 set of meetings at this point it sounds like.
so where's the 4h meeting gonna be 
email just came out from Jim Smith to everybody (hopefully)
Team,
Below is a message from School Board President Bernie Dorsey.  A small group met Sunday to continue working on defining a path forward for Skunkworks at the school. We invite Students, Parents and Mentors to come to the team meeting Tuesday at 6pm at RAHS to listen to the progress we have made, to ask questions, and help define the path forward.
 
Jim Smith
 
 
Hello all,
 
Thank you, again, for taking the time to work on the path forward for Robotics at RAHS. I am always impressed, and often amazed, at the level of commitment we all share for students and school.
 
Please share through your various networks, that we have reached an agreement, not one that is full and complete, but rather one that will enable us to move forward with the task at hand. An agreement that will achieve what we all desire, a unified team, anchored to RAHS, that will continue the tradition so many have worked so hard to build.
 
Rather than try to put into words all that was discussed, and all that has been worked through in the last two weeks, let’s all convene on Tuesday and we will navigate the path forward together. I would only ask that we continue to recognize that there are still questions to ask and answers to be found, but that we have somewhere to start.
 
I sincerely appreciate all that people have given to the team and to this process.
 
Please let Joe and I know when and where the team practice/meeting will be held so we can attend and assist in communicating the proposal to all concerned.
 
Take care and thanks again,
 
Bernie
I believe he has been included because he knows the most about the financial stuff, since he ran it all until this year
The issues started when he was still here, so he still has a say in things
No
Steve Burke is back.
Steve Burke
Burke?
and the coach from hi tekkers
all desilvas, jim smith, connie, both trever and his wife, burke, le bowlin, huntington
Are the representative group of mentors still Mr. Bowlin, Mr. DeSilva, and ??
Bernie’s message:

 

Hello all,

 

Thanks to everyone that attended last evening’s meeting. Your thoughts and input was incredibly valuable in providing a direction for which to continue towards a unified team at RAHS.

 

As a result of that meeting we have decided to further postpone practice to tentatively take place on 10/17. I realize this is a further delay at a critical point in the season. But in order to work toward getting things back on track, it is a necessary step.

 

The next piece on the path forward will be for myself, Joe Van, Ms. Tipton and a representative group of mentors to meet as soon as we are able. We are all in high hopes that this will lead us to the solution we all seek.

 

Thanks in advance for your understanding of the additional delay. And please join us in committing to a long term solution.

 

Take care,

 

Bernie

Ask forgiveness if it ends up being needed I guess
Tfw
Wilson says we actually HAVE to wait for Jerry
You should ask Tipton and/or Wilson to let you in
We can get started on the garnet and just set it off to the side until the trucks get here
If you know you are for sure attending and going to help clean, say so and we can at least start a schedule and for everyone else who shows up it can be first come first serve. Sound okay?
Where is the schedule for shifts?
We are waiting on Jerry, the trucks, and the MoF to open the gates so we can drive the trucks back there
Also do we need a mentor to clean the water jet, or else why are we waiting until 6?
We don't know who all intends to attend so we can't set up shifts
If we don’t know when were working, then we don’t know how to plan our out evening and won’t be able to attend.
When will we know what shifts we're working?
Can someone share the shifts spreadsheet so we know what time we are specifically working?

I thought we only had to sign up if we were at that school meeting
Are we cleaning the water jet right after school or normal meeting time?
Every one just needs to take a 10 min shift plz plus if you don't have clothes you can just cart the garnet out and there's no need to get dirty
Ohhh k cool
Kristina has a spreadsheet
Shifts 
Wait so how are 60 people going to fit into the shop
I heard Tipton say that today and Tuesday's meetings were both postponed
Just a heads up EVERYONE is expected to clean the water jet 
Please come help clean
Yes but still cleaning 
I think I heard Tuesday? Dunno
I heard postponed today, but not Tuesday
So Tipton canceled the meeting today and on Tuesday specifically
Yeah, you should also forward that email to them.
They had already filled it out so we had emails for them. 
Wasn't the survey also for cleaning the water jet out, they should know from that too.
An announcement is going to be made today
But how do the freshmen know that
The official team meeting is cancelled but the cleaning of the water jet is still on
So how are we going to alert the freshman and some sophomores that the meeting tonight is cancelled? There has been an email sent out by Bowlin from Bernie Dorsey to the people who are in the FRC Team email, but I doubt that includes the freshmen, so unless Tipton does something, the freshmen still believe there is a normal team meeting tonight
Here's hoping
We don't know
Last time they didn't want to cancel two days in advance bc of rides for freshmen
Will Tipton allow cancellation if it's the morning of?
you got my hopes up
ahhh man
Just the cancellation
it should be dealt with i.e. an announcement made tomorrow morning?
like the whole thing
wait
We've just been informed that it should be dealt with tomorrow morning. I know that's short notice but it seems that it was the best that could be done. Nothing moves as quickly as we would like. As of now that is all we know. We will keep you posted as we learn more but for now hang tight until tomorrow.
Anything?
<@U1F6AR1NF> <@U27TQ5U7K> <@U1F09HT4N>
its the end of the day and the announcement was never made. Does anybody have information as to why?
<@U1JM7GF7E> has left the group
It has a box to tell me a fun fact about you too, something I use to learn the Freshman names.
Yeah. I’m reusing the survey from the Freshmen. 
But it has parent information
We are doing this to make a list of groups to clean. 
You made a commitment to helping clean out the water jet. 
It says that it's a sign up for RAHS FRC team
Wait did I just make a commitment by filling that out?
I just didn't really understand it, based on the situation at hand.
We were told that this decision got pushed off to a later date? Isn't this kind of pressuring kids to decide now?
Thanks
If you don't want to fill it out don't 
sorry
It doesn't help anyone
Don't pick fights please
Literally if you don’t want to be involved don’t fill it out. Simple as that. 
But at this moment this is the fastest way to get the info out. 
don't you have a slack for the other team
I mean that people who are currently at robotics right now need to. 
Do you mean that Izzie doesn't have to do it, or the team in general?
What does that mean?
You don’t have to do it.

Reminder: The 4-H meeting is tomorrow at 6 at 2124 SW 146th St, Burien, WA. If anyone needs a ride, just let me know. There are plenty of mentors and parents willing to ferry students over. Hope to see you there!
Yeah my mom brought over two kids today (other than me and <@U1F0BGMLN>), and she said that if she gets to the school early enough she could do two trips to get more students 
I also have a seat for one more
Dm me if thats you
I can help give rides for people that can't make it to Burien.
Hey, so at the 4H Team meeting tonight, we wanted to give people who were still deciding where they wanted to go a chance to go to both team's meetings, So we decided to hold meetings on Mondays instead of Tuesdays at 6 - whenever. You can come earlier than 6, but be aware that it is the desilvas house they are volunteering up. Thursday meetings will be held at the same time as normal. Again the address is  2124 SW 146th St, Burien, WA. Thanks.
Yeah, I have been to/watched on the TV a lot of school board meetings before. Idk how we know if we made an impact, but I know that somehow people do get things done they that avenue
The desired solution being the school board placing pressure on the superintendent to solve the problem
Something like that
Ie a bunch of people showing up in skunk shirts
I could see it being possible to get support from the board with a show of solidarity from the team
^
Basically how it works is you get 4 min to say everything you want (they will ask you to stop when the 4 min is up) and then the next person goes 
I've never actually been to a school board meeting, but from what I understand people get an opportunity to speak and there is no response. If this is the case, I doubt our concerns will be heard any louder than they are at the building right now
There is a Highline school board meeting on Wednesday, October 4, during which students would be able to address the board for 4 minutes with concerns they have with the running of the team(s). I find myself hoping that this recent issue could be solved via intervention at a level higher than the school administration, and think that this could be an excellent opportunity for the team to band together.

The problem is no one will agree on which way a United team should go.

I think we can agree right here that that's not the case
ok but for real, student meeting today just to make sure splitting is the direction we want to go?
That better be a real picture

I dont know how relevant the vote at the 4H meeting at the mof is now
I mean based on the latest poll the decision has been split almost perfectly into thirds
Izzie, while that is certainly true. How many people truly thought that the 4H team would have to disassociate from the school? Even now when the administration has stated pretty explicitly that it is not going to happen plans are in the works to go above their heads and try to force this to happen.
Altho we were pretty much shut down, we have more options 
True
We're not done trying to cooperate; I'm not done trying to cooperate at least
I mean it is the school saying the 4H team can't stay at the school
When we voted 4-H it was made clear students had to be willing to leave if admin wouldn't cooperate
Still havent had a team meeting with both sides represented and one is not being planned
i agree nathan
Then you voted on an option that didn’t exist, being 4H and staying at the school.  
but idk
imo we should have a student meeting to make sure this is what we want
Both of those are fair
We didn't vote to leave the school.
The first step was when there were two different meetings 
guys this conversation is not helping or getting anywhere
In my opinion, voting to leave the school was the first step to splitting 
i agree, but the option to go back to one team hasn't gone away
It's like the first step to splitting
I mean they do have a temporary number and name already
maybe we should make the final decision of whether or not we're splitting or not before we have this conversation
I agree with Eli - this conversation is oriented as if it's inevitable that the team will split 
I'd be down for that. It'd be LIT :fire:
Ohhhhh, just to piss off speech and debate we should rob a zoo then go to one of their meetings and set a penguin on fire
It would be good to truly be a part of the school
Sci oly too
Turbulences mascot is the Phoenix 
A flaming penguin is basically a weird Phoenix 
Exactly
Like Nathan said last night it seems like we're ignoring the problem instead of trying to solve it
I mean skunks were a school team and it wasn't school related. Speech and Debate's mascot is the flaming penguins
why are we focusing on how to split instead of how to resolve the issue
Since we’re a school team 
Tbd but probably 
It will be related to the schools mascot though 
Do we get to vote on what we want our team name/mascot to be?
Cool
Yep
A placeholder so that we could submit our first preference. We should be getting a number close to 1983 as well as veteran status because we are doing a separation of two teams not a rookie team. 
200800431 is hardly memorable
lol
hopefully on the number part lol
It’s a temporary name and number btw

He does matter if he is making robotics students feel unwelcome in his classes
I  hate to say it but in this case, while he is a dick, he doesn't matter rn.
Saying he thinks robotics students are selfish, rebellious, don't need mentors or that mentors design/build the robot, etc.
What did he say?
Yeah, he thinks its funny when he's a dick to robotics kids. Although when I talked to him a few days ago, he wasn't trying to be funny, just being a dick. I mean he apologized about it later, but in an offhand way.
It has nothing to do with Tipton, it is that Joshi thinks that's a funny thing to say when the robotics students are undergoing so much
I mean Joshi doesn't represent Tipton, but yeah he's pretty upset about whats going on.
I mean I got that from sat team 
wow, so joshi *is* a dick
It was inappropriate 
I don't understand. They say they're on our side then they say things like that in front of other students
He's been like that for a few days now
it was obviously made in a derogatory sense
just so you're all aware: Joshi isn't afraid to make disrespectful comments in front of other students about the robotics team. During second period (&lt;5 minutes ago) he said "It would be cool to have a student and parent teams for Flight by Design. Oh wait, that's called robotics."

FRIED CHICKEN 
Oh jesus that ended on a weird note
Hey Patrick, I'm a little late to the conversation because I had homework to do. But I'd like to tell you that Izzie was NOT the person who called that meeting. She might've been at the front of the room, the the Tuesday meeting was called by two boys from the Sunday meeting. I thought I should clarify that. 
Okay nite everyone 
go to bed
oh gahd
uh oh
I'm looking it up
Why
Lol nite everyone
BIG NASTYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
Gross
chicken
Fried?
fried
Seconded
So let's try not to kill each other
Goodnight! It sure will be great seeing you at school tomorrow, and for the next eight or so months!
*I am going to bed now*
Idk about you Henry, but I come from SPS, where that was a bit of a norm. I guess it doesn't seem strange to me that if admin is unwilling to consider our side we move up the chain
you are entitled to your own opinion
From what I know to be true, I feel that this is unwise
This isnt a personal attack merely a warning
It seems to me that going above their heads is not somthing that has been fully thought out
now its ad hominem
Reckless: (of a person or their actions) without thinking or caring about the consequences of an action.
You called it a reckless course of action
Your most recent one
Which one
Yeah...
I challenge you to rewrite that statement without placing blame
Good point, except I think everyone else is asleep
I have stated the facts. I have stated the consequences. All that remains is to decide whether you wish to peruse the reckless course of action. I challenge you to think of it from their perspective even if you disagree. I am not the enemy here, we all just want what is best for the team
the conversation may have moved on by that point
Someone's there to defend, just maybe in the morning
that's fair I guess
it's not about the notifications, it's about the fact you would be making claims without anyone being here to defend 
that's not really fair though 
Like I said, you can respond whenever you want
Seriously tho we arent going to get anywhere with this, we should really go to bed
I want to stay positive, but I will note that I did not sense compromise coming from admin in other respects. Admin also tried to convince the students that they were wrong with the coaching decision and the time changes
there never had to be if they had let us have time to work things out. I understand that it would be short notice for the freshmen, but I think that could have been worked around
To attempt to go above the heads of the administration is to loose any good will still left. They already feel circumvented and cut off by this entire process and to do so again so blatantly to do what they want is a sure fire way to ensure that it will never become a possibility. This is a view that has even been expressed by members of the administration, strictly off the record.
what makes me so mad is that there is "another team operating there"
Compromise is viewed very different ways by different people and to state that the only solution that would constitute a compromise is one where 4H is the team at the school is to confuse the issue. I would challenge you to point to an unwillingness by the administration to work with the students to address their concerns and visions for the team, that still provides plenty of leeway for concession. I would highly encourage you to meet with Tipton to address these maters in a non-hostile way. You state that you claim that you are more than happy with the school administration retaining much of the control that they currently have and there are absolutely ways to do that in a non-4H way. 4H is not the only option to compromise. You state that they are unwilling to come to the table to discuss the option of compromise but I would rebut with that is exactly what they have been doing. We have been meeting with them constantly in the past week and we have started to make real progress and getting things confirmed in writing. The issue is that the administration feels to go 4H is to entirely to lose any sort of control that they currently possess. And while you note that it is the district that the contract is ultimately signed with, they will not blatently disreguard the wishes of the school. Especially if there is another team already opperating there.
That explains it
Yeah... Found that out when I stopped getting slack notifications randomly....
just an fyi for everybody, you can autosnooze notifications after a certain time in the day so that you won't get notifications while you're sleeping.
its thursday now, 0011 hours
Nathan it is tomorrow
Shh the children are sleeping
tipton says she is for the *students,* so now that the *students* have voted she wont consider our ideas
perhaps we continue this tomorrow ?
which is not what the *students* decided they wanted
That does not give much leeway at all for any concession
But administration right now has taken the stance that the only possible team to exist at the school is one run by the school.
her idea of "what is best for the students" is also exactly what she has in mind, exactly what she wants, and exactly what she expects. it seems less and less reasonable that she wants to make any sort of compromise every time she turns us down
You may say that compromise would be letting go the option of 4H; Ok! I'm fine with that! Lets discuss the possibilities about how the team may move forward for the coming year and years to come.
I agree with Eli, tipton seems very sure that she wants to make no concessions
We have been flat out denied the opportunity to discuss what it may mean for the school, for the future of the team, and for the future of the _students_ that want to take part in robotics. From my point of view, I am more than happy with the school administration retaining much of the control that they currently have; but I personally would like to work out terms so that news about changes isn't so sudden. That's personal; what matters right now is the ability to come to the table and compromise. I feel like we haven't been given the opportunity to do so.
Alrighty then...
However, you can't deny that administration has flat out denied requests to compromise and find an inbetween. So far I have seen no concession from the administration on that point. Someone may try to bring up (again) that we have a similar stoic point: No. We wish to discuss the possibilities and what it would take to form an MOU, and what those terms would be. Do we want to hold a discussion about that? Yes. Will we compromise if we ever discuss the possibility? Yes, it's a memorandum of understanding, not a lets use the facilities and demand that we run the team the way we want.
Feel free to respond whenever you'd like
Eli I really do not wish to debate the merits of that with you right now, can we all go to bed now and address that tomorrow
I understand that going over people's heads is often not the best option
<@U1F6AR1NF> school admin has made it clear that the option that is best for the team isn't going to work for the school. The district has the final authority over everything that happens in the district; if we come to an MOU with the district than we may still be able to work out a solution that is best for both "sides"
Yeah I'm gonna go pass out now, and by that I mean go on reddit on my phone for like an hour
Fair
Nothing else is going to get done here tonight. Lets all try to be awake tomorrow
Gudor said that the "other team will 'go away'"
Lol <@U1F0BJN5U> 
Same to you!
Go to bad y'all
happy 9/28 everyone
Well 4-H says MOA with district...
Yes, pissing them off sounds like a swell idea...
To try to go over Tipton's head
I understand some people are emailing school board members and the superintendent 
<@U1F6AR1NF> pinned their Word Document <https://skunkworksteam1983.slack.com/files/U1F6AR1NF/F79HCTYHF/september_27th_morning_meeting_with_tipton_-_edit.docx|September 27th Morning Meeting with Tipton.docx> to this channel.
Give me a second to find the relevant passage
I read it
Unless we are sponsored by the school and not 4H they have said it aint happening. I encourage you to read the meeting transcript
Or will it only happen under mysterious circumstances with shady deals made in dark rooms
Have gudor/Tipton said anything specific about 1983 returning to being affiliated with the school?
because I do, indeed, judge the fudge
Its solid
I still like mine <@U1F408NA0>
Lol :joy::joy:
izzie the wizzie
no worse than <@U1F0P4FA5> :grin:
eh, its fine
Lol
side note i see now that <@U1F0M8ZTP> is super pretentious and i should try to change that
then please explain what is
Not at all
That is not true <@U1F0M8ZTP> 
so what's more valuable to you <@U1F0P4FA5>? That 34.3% of students get to do a 4H team outside of school or that all of us can stay as one team?
That's not a compromise
We can either merge the 2 teams back into one or transition skunk works back to school run and get rid of the other team. Both options would require school sponsorship, but they would like to be clear that that option is available.
Admin said no to 4-H in school
What options?
Administration has made it clear that they are willing persue those options, the question is, are we?
That is true
registration doesn't end this discussion, there is still options avalible to us to become united again
I still want one meeting with both sides
To both <@U1F0QEL0Z> and <@U1F6AR1NF> 
True
We all agree on that but we still cannot come to some form of agreement on which of the two teams is the better option
If a team has already been registered, then this conversation wasn't necessary to begin with.
Well while we are working with Tipton we can't change it without her
 ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
this conversation was never about how undecided people would pick a team, it's that maybe two teams isn't the right option 
Exactly
If you go to the 4h meeting tomorrow, you can go to the RAHS one tuesday
I mean they take place at the same time so like its not possible
i'd say different days
I don't think people can attend both Thursday meetings though, I'm not sure if that's what you mean or not Izzie
both
I would like to attend both and probably have one meeting with both sides as well
<@U1F0QEL0Z> pinned a message to this channel.
YES
I think the best way for undecided people to make up their minds isn't with another student meeting, but by simply attending both meetings and seeing what they like better. They should pick a team for how it runs, not what their friends tell them.
Guys this was never about us. Each side wanted what was best for them. This was never truly our decision this was whoever could voice their opinions the loudest. Personal thoughts 
real decision
real options
If people have registered a team, I think that's pretty cool
what?
I don't know if this is a bad feeling, but that's pretty neat.
I agree
imo i think we should have another student meeting just so the undecided people can see both sides without having to worry about reading 2000 slack msgs 
Idk ask Ailis, shes the one who said it happened
but mr. gudor said that  we can "make that team go away" if the team decides to back away from 4H
ooooooooohhhh what's their number?
yes
maybe it's too late 
i believe that another teams been registered, no?
what do we do? how do we fix what's happened
Even at the parent meeting. Mrs. Tipton attempted to speak out a couple of times and was torn apart by parents unwilling to accept what she was saying. I do not know what meeting you were at if you couldn't tell she wasnt on the verge of tears. I agree she could have stood up for herself but she was going up against some pretty overwhelming odds with neither gudor or wilson to back her up either
the one that happended yesterday
That's fair, that's why I talked with Henry about the option of staying at school so now I'm firmly on the fence because now I know more about both options
what? no the parent meeting over a week ago now
It became dominated by 4H parents and mentors and with nobody from the school administration, and with Mrs. Wilson afraid to speak, wild accusations flew around unchecked and in the end we made the decision with leadership of only really half of the options present
if people are already set on 4h, this entire conversation served no purpose 
ok, thanks for letting me know 
not everyone
both parties can be present but never in equal standing, one is always outweighed by the other and the people present affect the points that are made
it was too soon, but that was a meeting that happened with everybody
That was supposed to be the idea of the meeting on tuesday but that wasn't what ended up happening
I agree with that Henry. Mostly by parents and mentors. Mentors probably won't apologize for that either
<@U1F0W3FFC> parent meeting on tuesday
i confirm, <@U1F0W3FFC>
And can we all just agree that Mrs. Wilson was treated very unfairly. She was terrified to speak out after she got torn apart for simply speaking up. Thats why she left.
the irreversable decision was made when izzie said that there would be a meeting on thursday. I do not want to criticize her, but i feel that the calling of that meeting symbolizes the start of two teams and now we have to choose
there has never been a meeting where there are both parties present to my knowledge, someone confirm?
because every meeting was weighted in favor of one or the other. on tuesday, we didnt know what 4H was, so we disregarded it. on sunday, all of the adults there were hugely in favor of 4H, and so we wanted 4H. last night, coach and the mentors were all in favor of 4H. i can say personally I did not feel comfortable speaking against 4H and commend harrison for his bravery to stand up and speak against the mentors, even though i was undecided then and am undecided now
well it might already be made nvm 
Who should apologize to who, who didn't apologize to who in a reasonable time frame, is this reasonable, can the mentors say that, can the administration do this, can we vote on that
then why don't we wait before making an irreversible decision 
We don't even know what the problems are; that's what we're arguing about right now
nobody is trying to say that we shouldn't try to fix what's going on
nobody is trying to say there aren't problems
They're undecided and uninformed, not childish
<@U1F0W3FFC> nobody is trying to avoid the problems
4H or you are against the team and personally driving a knife into the heart of coach feels like how it has been portrayed
There are adults who swing back and forth
why can't we just address the problems that we're having instead of completely avoiding them?
Because we haven't made a final decision yet it makes us childish? That's insane logic
i went to every one and switched every time
nothing against a 4H meeting but it felt biased from the start
and they still switched
because I know people who went to every one
the sunday meeting felt like a 4H orgy from the start and nobody there spoke against it
I think it shows that we are still kids
exactly
and who felt invited
I think that is in part indicitive of who was able to go
exactly.
tuesday: lets stick with the school. Sunday: lets go 4H. Tuesday: Lets stick with the school. Tuesday: Lets go 4H.
every single meeting that there was student attendance at, the feel of what was going to happen how flipped 180 degrees
Hardly seems like leaving the team on equal footing
The vote was called basically with the last word coach crying....
wtf???
imagine if you only got to hear one candidates campaign speech before voting 
how are you going to let a room full of adults influence our opinions literally 15 minutes before we vote, with nobody to defend the claims they're attaching?
yeah everyone is so hostile to her and expects us to be treated with the utmost respect
the mentors used themselves and their connections as bargaining chips. it felt so wrong
We're criticizing her for not apologizing to Thomas, when the mentors/parents won't apologize either
i definitely saw that
if nobody else sees this, i don't want to have anything to do with anything related to skunkworks, 4h or no 4h
the fucking mentors of our team accused her of being a liar, a hypocrite, and being hard to deal with, while at the same time threatening us that if we stay with the school we would lose our business partners (first of all, what??) and that they would all leave 
It's ridiculous the technicalities she's used to enable her to claim that there are 2 teams right now. There don't have to be at all. We attempted to work it out so that there wouldn't be a split meeting. They said no. We had the meeting, then they said that there are 2 teams now and we have to choose
i dont see how that is such a big problem for her
there does not need to be two teams if the one at the school was 4H
I mean at the meeting, 2/3 said they wanted 4H, and now only 1/3 want 4H
That is just *wrong*
That was hardly her only response, She also said there is already a team of students at the school and she cannot allow both to remain
and if we weren't on tuesday?
I mean that statement isn't inaccurate
She responded "You guys were influenced by other parties at a meeting on Sunday"
From what I understand, we let Tipton know that the students decided that 4H is the direction we wished to take, and that we wanted to continue partnership with the school and work out a solution best for both parties
And she is actually working with us now...
where was the communication before the incident? nonexistent 
after the fact of our mentor being kicked, sure
We've been talking to tipton for days about what we want
the problem is that tipton doesn't know what "the kids" want 
There are robotics teams of only students
even though we're just kids it's obvious that all of tiptons decisions are made in the best interest of "the kids"
r/im14andthisisdeep
You also cant have a robotics team of only mentors
hey I'm still 12 so I have a little mah ture en to do still
can't have an FRC team of only students
I hate to break it to you but we aren't really kids any more...
Can't have an FRC team of only mentors
Who cares if we're kids, the kids are the team
I mean we are "just kids"
So mentors are ignoring what happened because of their feelings? Because of their bias towards Tipton even though she listens to students and is actively trying to be better?
everyone keep singing "its all about the students" and we are the ones being fucked
thats the part that I cant get past
we have stood up a lot and if they dont see that why are we the ones who suffer
I don't see that either, but that is how they feel
its not avoiding the problem. We presented a solution that we believe would fix the problem, and solve others along the way. They said take the highway.
I don't see how we haven't stood up for the mentors
then why don't we fix it?! how is avoiding the problem altogether fix the problem 
?
But thats exactly what we did for Thomas
the mentors have expressed that they don't feel the students will really stand up for them
doesn't garuntee it won't happen again
She certainly learned that lesson the hard way.
Isn't the system for mentors to feel protected through the students? So far it seemss Tipton has learned her lesson about trying to kick off mentors, and that the students will stand up to her and protect the mentors.
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
slack ruins lenny
quite the long face there
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
rofl
"succ"
"suck it up"
"Gudor feels as though the team is not student run enough. 
Challenges the mentors to suck it up and support the students either way the decision works out. 
"
i have no knowledge of a mentor attempting to speak to tipton other than thomas 
Through her open door
that was directed towards mentors. Thomas DeSilva was removed from the team for voicing his concerns.
To my experience, I have yet to find a time when that is not the case eli
"our team simply cannot run effectively"
One of the things we really should work with her towards that hasn't really been touched is mentor safety the question is now what sort of reassurances do the mentors require that would allow all of them to feel safe
"my door is always open to you" is it really?
"The mentors role on the team should be to help the students not to do administration"
I understand she is making an effort, but it's still not nearly enough
it's not tipton, it's the lack of a process
it's not that they can't feel comfortable, it's that there are no systems in place to make them feel comfortable 
you're right, it hasn't been discussed, but it happened anyway
<@U1F6AR1NF> uploaded a file: <https://skunkworksteam1983.slack.com/files/U1F6AR1NF/F79HQQ6RX/pasted_image_at_2017_09_27_11_08_pm.png|Pasted image at 2017-09-27, 11:08 PM> and commented: Internet it how you will, while it isn't anything that hasn't been said before let me just put out there what she said in her email:
mentors can't feel comfortable under tipton
there's never been a system in place for the principal to have a say in which mentors can come 
i don't think it's ever been discussed
That is not at all an accurate representation of what she has said patrick
that's not entirely true 
tipton is adamant that she wont allow a program at the school where mentors feel comfortable
because we did and it was rejected
because neither side will budge
why can't we come up with a solution that doesn't invoke a split 
you're assuming that the only way the mentors will work with us is if we go 4h though 
I mean it seems like with student input we were able to get Thomas back at the school, ignoring the point of his hurt feelings.
I can grow old with my friends, but when is the point I don't have access to the mentors? 2 years, for others 1,3,4 years left. Then that's pretty much it, then what I learn in college will be as much as they can give me.
same 
I'm assuming that's rhetorical at this point
imo it's not that she removed thomas, it's that the mentors realized that she had the power to remove anyone she wanted at any time. they realized there was no protection for them, and the 4h would be the best way to ensure that that cannot happen again. why can't we just solve this issue while staying as a singular team at the school? 
I feel that way too! Mr weeks has taught me so much and I really value his input but I would be appalled if he told me that he wouldnt stay at the school and teach me and henry because mrs tipton removed thomas desilva for a total of less than 24 hours
i do feel like although the mentors need to be considered, they became far too crucial in people's decision making... mentor-based, not mentor-run
To me the mentors have made the most impact on what I want to do for my career.
not out loud, yet...
nobody is branding you a traitor
its fine if you think that i just want to know what the truth is.... who do we prioritize?
Cad I should amend, I have learned cad from other students
Exactly, loathe as I am to agree with anything the administration said and be branded as a _traitor_ by the team. I agree with Mr. Gudors point in the meeting this morning which is that I feel the outcome of the meeting could have looked very different last night if the students did not feel that the mentors would only respect the outcome and stay with the team if the team voted 4H
(I would argue Tucker) yes, yes, maybe, no
so the mentors are more important than the students?
I can't learn from other students how to do cad or how to program or how to use the shop or how to stress test
Much fair points
:thinking_face:
If the students are really the most important part of the team then why are the students being split just so the mentors can all stay together?
while we can attempt to be purely objective, that doesn't matter when a person doesn't feel welcome. whether that's a petty decision or one that shouldn't affect the team, it has and it will, and I don't believe the blame should be put on the mentors for that
We'll she never apologized or said sorry about Thomas DeSilva
or saying she was wrong in any way
she did so without apologizing
To present the most direct counter point to that, once it was evident that *The Students* wanted Thomas Desilva back, he was invited back within 24 hours. I would argue that they only really care about the input that the students provide. Not to say that they aren't controlling, and we still need to wary of Tipton just saying things and now following through with them. But if we can achieve more meetings with her with results in writing, like today. The issue of lack of control goes away. Again, I'm on the fence, and you bring up a very valid point but I want to ensure all views are represented.
I'm not saying you're wrong
To present the most direct counterpoint you can get, the school cares more about controlling the team than listening to anybody it seems like. I'm on the fence too, but I'm not comfortable with leadership that will directly lie to us, tell us we have a say, then say that our say was wrong.
The one thing I am very uncomfortable about with this notion that we will "lose the mentors", is the idea that the mentors care more about their perceived feeling after one extremely poorly handled reaction than then care about working with the students. I feel that the mentors that really feel that the students are the most important thing about the team wouldn't force the students to choose between options presented as "mentors" or "no mentors". While I am still on the fence I feel that at a certain point people need to push personal grievances aside, and really make a go of it. In all fairness they have treated the administration much worse. This is not to say they didn't deserve the outcry they recieved. But before the mentors choose to really leave they should ask what matters to them more.
it really doesn't matter, but I really don't have a year to wait on what way the team is going, that's my two cents
Do you literally mean you're building a house? I mean you have your vote and all, but that doesn't really apply to the rest of the team
we are in the process of getting a house up here, we can stop that and move back home. I don't have a year.
if it were that simple nobody would say "no that's a bad idea"
its not that simple
Tell that to the mentors
we lose the mentors
Guys this doesn't have to happen we can give it another year
I won't deny it. I just think people have to go with whatever they think will be best for them, and hope for the best, honestly.
if anyone is still denying that this is shattering the team then they are lying to themselves and everyone else
that is an almost exact split in thirds
thats fucking ridiculous
Holy crap that's close, like within margin of error. Especially since a few students haven't voted yet.
So does he not want any of the booster club money (which is in the bi-laws) if the 4H-team explodes? 
"Gudor states that once we break off from the school and become a 4H team, the team will not be able to come back to the school." 
I feel that this is something that should be clarified.

She has verified in writing the accuracy of all of these notes. Any questions or awkwardly phrased passages please direct your questions towards me or the other people at the meeting today (Me, David, Izzie, Evan, Erin).
I know I can't really mend the pain, but I'll say this, I know robotics isn't the only thing keeping friend ships together. You are friends because you've been at the same school, worked on the same projects, know the same people. It's a small school. It's up to all of us to keep our friends together. If someone is feeling bad, tell them that you are there for them. Who says we can't work together on the same things. Who says we can't make the same decisions. I will continue to be friends with everyone here, because I know who they are as people. Robotics may have introduced me and set up my friendships, but it's mine, and in effect, our choice to keep them as friends. If it's the president I vote for, or the team I root for, or the robotics team I'm apart of. I will never let that get in the way of just being able to talk to someone, ask them how their day is going, ask them how their project is going, ask them what they are planning on doing for the robot. They are still my friend. If they choose to push you away, it's not your decision, it's them not being able to accept you for who you are. I can't stress enough how important it is for all of us, to come together in more than just robots; Because that is what this is all about, more than just robots.
and I hate using their names but this is the situation I've been put in
I have to choose in the near future whether I want to be on a robotics team with Eli or a robotics team with Henry. They are my best friends and I have loved being on skunkworks with them both and now I have to chose which teammate I want
Tucker, we went to katsu burger and had a nice dinner yesterday. now that might not happen anymore
which is why you shouldn't let them tear your friendships apart
and by me and my friends i mean all of you too!
But its me and my friends who pay the price. Principals and mentors and coaches and parents all keep talking about how "Its about the students" and yet all of us are the ones being *forced to suffer*
it really doesn't have to be this way
I think we should all remember, whatever choice we choose, who did this to us. it's not our friends who did this.
I know that whatever meeting I go to will not be my final choice
I don't see how we can be happy in the end. I'm sorry to sound pessimistic, but I feel like now I have to decide which friends I want keep. There's no way that there won't be animosity between the two teams. The lunch table I sit at consists of almost all Skunkworks students and I know that not all of us will join the same team. Is anyone going to seriously tell me that if that after our robotics team splits, my friend group wont? Can anyone seriously tell me that everyone who was friends before this will stay friends no matter what team we join? Most of us are friends *because* of this!

I just cried my eyes out, I feel like I want to throw up, I feel like I'm having to choose between my best friends, and there's no way that we are all going to come out of this better off. I know I'm not going to be happy in the end, and I can't imagine anyone being happy with this split.
I hope no matter what happens or if/where we all go, I hope we are all happy and can do robotics. We are all a family and it's sad to see the split but if we all happy in the end, that's what matters the most 
And I do truly believe that
we will all come out of whatever this fiasco was, together and stronger
I don't think people should feel sick, we are all friends in the end
Coopertition, right?
<@U1F0P4FA5> pinned a message to this channel.
do what feels best for you, you will still see everyone at school, on the field
How can I choose
i totally agree, it's sad that a family is being disassembled with such ease and we shouldn't allow it to happen
I know
I know, it's still sad 
it's the admin
Yeah, me too
It's not the students that are forcing this
and I know its not final but I actually feel sick to my stomach
it makes me sick to think that we're already splitting into groups
Sorry it's so formal, I pretty much copy and pasted the email I wrote 
@channel The DeSilva's have graciously agreed to host the 4-H team meeting tomorrow night from 6-8 pm. This will be a student and mentor meeting, as many team meetings have been in the past, and the focus will be on working out our season details. The address is 2124 SW 146th St, Burien, WA. Carpools are encouraged, so if your parents are driving you, ask if there is room in the car to take more students to the meeting. If anyone has trouble making it to the meeting for transportation reasons, please let me know. Please RSVP if you are coming!
P.S. I understand that some students are not getting these emails, so please pass the message along.
If anyone is staying with the school and would like to stay informed we have a group chat. Let me know if you want to join. Anyone can join but we'll be planning the school team so you'll just get spammed? Up to you tho. 
Okay, we are at 24 responses! I think that means 14 more people need to fill out the survey
Okay, I only have 17 responses. Plz fill out survey! <http://goo.gl/forms/HHtpgvxy2R1EgRbr2>
Ok, sounds good
About their options for teams
Ok
About...?
To the RAHS practice to talk to them, in an unbiased manner. 
To talk to the freshmen
Going where izzie?
<@U1F09HT4N> is going tomorrow
if there is a 4H team, would they be able to talk to the freshman about it, maybe going up at a meeting and talking about the options? I understand if the RAHS team doesn't want it to pull kids away, but giving them an option too would be the most fair decision imo.
I am asking for students to make a decision by the end of October, at least in regards to the RAHS team. And our coaches didn’t think that was unreasonable. 
thats with the assumption that there are two teams though
mainly just in build season
Exactly
But I think that if someone joined either side, was there for a month, and decided it wasn't for them, they could choose to go back. Neither team will be large enough that it would be an issue
Yes, I agree
At some point I feel a student should pick, because if other people on either side rely on that person, It's not fair to either if they are constantly just giving 50% to each side.
Can you clarify?
Not saying "oh let's switch back and forth every day", more on the lines of things that are imperative now that the school can bring while the 4h get's a better footing
that's if we decide that there will for sure be a 4h split though. i don't think that until we're absolutely 100% certain we're splitting we should talk about the nature of how a 4h team would function. it's not healthy for the atmosphere imo
Kids can change their minds after eventually picking. I don't think either side would exclude them
Also, if the split it made will kids be able to switch later on? Because I know some people were wanting to stay because of stuff like smelly, but if they could stay at school, then join the 4H I think that would be a lot better for everyone.
just a thought, but coach brought up a great point that no matter what happens, if we have the same 1/3 vs 2/3 division either team won't survive, 4h or non-4h
basically nothing is final yet so please keep your options open. 
How much time?
People have time to make up their minds
and will not
ok, just making sure
no it should not
No, not at all
just curious
are you saying that which meeting we attend tomorrow decides our future on the team?
On that note izzie, is there two meetings tomorrow again?
We just need to know who will be at which meeting
not saying anyone is saying that
i totally agree
exactly nathan
burning bridges saying we're kicking people isn't very productive imo
Nothing is final yet, but it remains that there are two meetings tomorrow
seems like everyone is certain that the team is splitting into 4h/non-4h, to my understanding nothing is final yet
<@U1F0QEL0Z> pinned a message to this channel.
I completely agree, not saying I've been the nicest I could, but I will be and have been trying to move towards that
Just wanted to throw this out here: can we please act a bit more professional, and respect each other and use a bit nicer wording? I'm not specifically saying this about a particular person but just in general. People who are less outspoken aren't going to want to share their opinion which is important, if they feel as though they will get shut down or people will be rude to them. I really think we need to have a better attitude about this and try to be mature and kinder to eachother about all that's happened. This is tough on all of us but it's not going to resolve ourselves if both sides are being rude to eachother. (Again just a general idea)
payton nothing's hostile about it we just need a meeting space and to be able to tell who's moving on. There's no judgment or anything we just need to know
how so?
This seems a little hostile like I gave my name but it just seems stupid. 
Probably before build season
On another point, when does it have to be final?
But I thought it wasn't final?
going to have to give names anyways at some point
Well, if this is the slack that stays with the team, I also need to know who to remove.
could also be used for a finale list
Why do we need to input our full names? I mean this is just my personal opinion, but I just kind of feel like if you're just trying to get a generalization for how big of a meeting space you need to have you don't necessarily need to have our name 
Hey everyone, seeing as we need to determine how much room we need in a new meeting space, we need to know how many students may come with the 4H team. Please fill out the following survey. No one will be discriminated against for their choice, we just need to know. It is also perfectly fine to be undecided, and that is included as an option.

I  can’t get the museum for Thursday, so if someone else has a location that’d be pretty cool
We are most likely not meeting at the school on Thursday. However, it is my understanding that negotiations will continue
That second sentence didn't make sense
I mean only thing stopping us from meeting at the school on Thursday is Tipton decision
We shall see what Tipton says, then make the decision
I don't think that everybody is on the same page. What is the intention for the meeting? I think we need to start having much clearer agendas
Thursday?
woo more meetings
Agreed 
i think we should have another student meeting to talk about the future of the team and make sure everyone is on the same page
I think it's for sure time soon to talk about things
I don't think that's unreasonable given that he hasn't completed his research
Which he agreed to
Well I have asked him to keep quiet until he releases the article
Especially not a parent
Cause timo has every right to talk at this point, nobody can ask him not to
yep
Oh do you mean to non-robotics members?
maybe another student meeting ?
Like just in general talking to people and allowing ourselves to talk about the situation
I mean telling people what's happened
What do you mean by talking to the rest of the school? For now we are setting up a meeting with Ms. Tipton for tomorrow
I have arguments for and against
Are we still not talking to the rest of the school about this?
For students who were not at the meeting, it was moderated by a group of four students (myself, <@U1F1395TK>, <@U27TQ5U7K>, and <@U1F6AR1NF>), as well as by Mr. Wright. It was decided in a student vote that the "team" would begin work towards becoming a 4H-sponsored team at the school. Currently a group of students is working to start talks with Ms. Tipton, and hopefully we will figure things out from there. No matter what happens, I hope that this is the beginning of healing and getting back to being a Skunk Family. 
So who is going to upload notes/transcripts from tonights meeting?

Everyone remember: there is a meeting in Gudor's after school to hear what he has to say about tonight's meetings.
Nah just Tipton
Shouldn't we set the channel topic to something relevant like "Speak your mind if it's relevant to the entire team" or something
heyy that doesn't sound unreasonable
noice
WE DID IT 
<@U1F6AR1NF> pinned a message to this channel.
Hey all, David and I just talked with Mrs. Tipton. While it was a very brief meeting there were a number of important takeaways from it. 
1) No retribution whatsoever of any sort will be brought upon any students, mentors, or parents that attend the meeting tonight. 
2) Her explicitly stated preference is to continue with the team as it is right now. 
3) She made it clear that the team splitting is the least preferable option to her and that one person will not be enough to split the team. 
4) While it was not stated outright it is clear to us that the only way that she will accept the decision to go 4H is if it is the one that the STUDENTS make. We as the students will then need to be the ones who present it to her and make the decisions about it. 
5) If 4H is the option that we choose we will be able to use the shop, although in what capacity will have to be negotiated in the 4H agreement. 
6) She repeatedly stated that she wants whatever is best for the students.

Okay I think talking about talking too much is defeating the purpose of the conversation, so are we good?
This group chat is like reading the terms and conditions
You are freaking out more than he is
Lol sorry couldn't help myself
:face_with_rolling_eyes: ok I'm trying defend you izzie but thanks 
Payton are you insane
It was 8:33...
Ok Isaac, one that was rude af. Two, would you rather have us have a private group chat where we talk about everything? So that everyone is left in the dark like before? Sure it can get a little annoying but there's so much we need to talk about and I'd rather have everyone have a fair and equal chance to participate than a back room meeting like before. Honestly dude you need to chill out. That didn't help anyone and just got me pissed. It's not even 8:30 in the morning. Chillllllllllll tf out

I need you all to understand something. You can't act like when you put a message here, you're whispering to one individual person. Everyone on the team gets these messages. Every little thing you put here goes to everyone. If you don't have something important as fuck to say and you put it here, you've just made everyone who looks through here trying to find something important read YOUR message. The vast majority of messages here are completely useless. I know I'm not the only one sick of clicking the notification on slack and having to scroll through 200+ messages looking for the one that has any meaning. Stop making us dig through the stack of half hay half SHIT looking for the one God damn needle.
Students who wish to hear from Gudor/Wilson before the off-campus meeting tonight should go to Mr. Gudor's room after school
<@U1F0QEL0Z> set the channel's topic: just tipton
<@U1F1ETJM7> set the channel's topic: apparently more than just robots meant a _lot_ more than we were expecting
much meetings
Mr. Wright has brought up Skunk Works mission on website (which should be included in meeting next to FIRST mission and RAHS mission) (confirm)
I can confirm
Oh okay can someone else?
I didn't really catch that part
Coach is saying that 4H is good for district to develop a unified policy on how FRC teams are run, so we should run the same way as high teckerz and ramen (confirm)
Sorry I misunderstood the what we were seconding on 
I'm confirming what's being said
I totally agree and we need to get it in writing (im not here, but just added my opinion)
But I believe she will do that 
No 
Ohhh man party in the library
Wait Payton you are here?
Get it in writing 
Confirm
Yes. 
Again can someone else second
Parents are concerned about the possibility that Tipton is only giving us the booster club for now bc she is under pressure, but she might rescind later (as she has tried to do with meeting times)
Yes
and wow that's a step in the right direction
here is the the email^^^
Confirmed
Yeet
Someone else confirm
Sounds like Tipton reluctantly agreed to allow booster club to run spaghetti dinner?
<https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nPaKPoRuwReIZ1nZImXxt9IZeUsfp0r67sdrZDl7zjo/edit?usp=sharing>
yes, sounds good.
Ok sounds good can we not spam this chat anymore 
guys this conversation is going to get nowhere. we will discuss all of this tomorrow night at the musuem of flight
So what mentor would want to waste their time if they could just be pushed out at any second
Right but again all she can do is remove people
But it happened 
That has been revoked
It cuts out Tipton from doing anything
Thomas was banned
What retribution? They’re volunteers not employees 
And they don't want to be stressed like that
Mentors are afraid of retribution
hold on, lets just read the email. ill attach it right now
Wait so they’re going to leave... bc they are scared of leaving?
We have better ability to choose meeting times
Mentors will leave if they don't feel safe
Mentors feel safe
Greater autonomy 
Insurance
Someone summarize the benefits of 4h
But I need to wait until after meeting
Yeah
Idk how to attach it
you could ask Jim Smith about that, isn't he at the booster club meeting?
Apparently the email lists are broken 
Just attach it here
I didn't?
Lots of people didn't
Someone forward it!
Well shoot
Same
 I didn't get an email from david
I will meet everyone at the Anderson statue 
Yes. 
Yes
Is the rbc the place the sat and ap tests were held?
There's fire everywhere and no one knows how to put it out. It seems like every liquid is gasoline 
rbc= red barn classroom
which is what was said in the email
At RBC
There was a lot of discussion and then it was decided that we would do what we planned initially
Do that
No
Did u read email
Someone give me a tldr
Lol
Holyyy balls 
But I thought the two emails would be unrrelated
I have
no i thought you were emailing gudor and wilson first
Have u sent out the email yet?
just saying that the meeting tomorrow is at the red barn classroom at 6pm at the MOF because some people aren't getting the emails so spreading the word as much as possible it good
What do u mean?
Not really related...
whoever is at the booster club meeting, could you please bring up the location for the meeting tomorrow?
<@U1F0QEL0Z> set the channel's topic: MAKING THIS TEAM NOT EXPLODE
My phone is screwy
Okay, I will once I get into a wifi zone
okay then izzie can you write them email to gudor and wilson then asking to meet with them after school at least before 6 so we can hear (and listen and learn) their thoughts and opinions?
Ok you probably have the most info here 
Again, <@U1F0P4FA5> here
It's not telling him what to do
 ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
It's to us
It isn't to Tipton 
This is different
Idk I wouldn’t run the risk of making them feel hijacked again
Not run by him
Not for our location for an off campus meeting
For cancelling meetings
Gudor was very clear that we need to run emails by him first 
So parents and mentors know
We need to get location out first
This is <@U1F0P4FA5> 
No location won't change either way
Yes
okay so should would email them before emailing the skunk family about the location?
At this point the only thing to do is ask them
^
ask them
yeah exactly. do you think the students meeting with them after school is enough?
Last time we did that we alienated them and members of our team
But I agree we need to involve the interim coaches before making a decision 
I can get y’all in the side of the barn
and say take your pick
i'd just say that there are two
also <@U1FAR4AJU> where are we entering...from the outside or the inside?
i feel like we need to reach out and email gudor and wilson before emailing everyone else? or not and should i just say that the location for tomorrow’s meeting is the red barn classroom
david why did you abstain
who is gonna make the email? 
Sounds good
we inform parents mentors and the like in this email
*so we are going to have parallel meetings, at school and at red barn and gudor and wilson will have a meeting with us before the main meetings start so that everyone get's a say, choose what you want to do (talk to new kids, or go talk about future stuff)*
Yes 
and what is fo shizzle
Izzie can't get wifi or data
gimmie two secs
Please reiterate the decision for folks who don't want to trawl through a mile of text
No data
<@U1F0P4FA5> says fo shizzle 
<!channel>
we all good in the hood with the decision ? 
i thought that was what we decided?
so same deal that we started with?
so have we notified the parents and mentors of the final location and have we requested to meet with gudor and wilson after school? 
Mostly parents
I know it was both our parents and our mentors advising us
He did not specify bc he doesn't know
Parents. Mentors. 
Which adults in particular 
Why do you think they are pushing back so hard on us meeting and figuring out 4h and what's going on? What's their skin in the game? They don't want to stay on as permanent coaches, they made that clear by saying they were interim coaches. They're manipulating us by saying our parents of all people don't care for our best interest. I don't think we can go into a meeting assuming the best of them either. 
the adults being the mentors and parents?
He said, and he admitted he might be totally wrong, that it seemed to him that the adults guiding us didn't have our best interests at heart
hmmm by who? alrighty so someone should write and email to the students and gudor and wilson asking to meet immediately after school
Maybe partially
So idk that he trusts us entirely to have our own opinions 
I would note that he also thought we were being manipulated...
we have to keep an open mind to new ideas and opinions
From what gudor said he seemed like he was legit trying to help us
exactly
we can’t go into this thinking they are the enemy 
True
Watch the time
We can say we have to go now
Well they can't stop you from walking away even if it's a little rude
After school is easier
They’re not plotting against us, they won’t prevent us from going to the meeting
no do it after school
But we have to be careful not to make up our minds without hearing all info (from Gudor/Wilson and from parents/mentors)
and maybe we even invite them to the meeting the museum of flight, and that way we made the gesture and if they don’t cancel the meeting they can’t come
Do it before school
If it's after school they could just keep talking and not let you go to the meeting
They can’t cancel the school meeting 
Okay
i think that is okay if they don’t come ONLY if we meet with them beforehand to hear their thoughts and opinions
I do agree they might not like that
You should meet beforehand, but not after school
Unless they cancel parallel meeting
Agreed
Well there's no other way to get them to meeting
Agreed
i agree bella
I think having them Skype will make them feel disrespected but idk that’s just my thoughts 
Also allowing them opportunity to skype in for small portion of meeting
Immediately after school might be good
I do want to once again reemphasize that gudor and wilson felt they wanted to be included so (if we aren’t going to go with thursday even though we should to allow for more communication) maybe should propose having a meeting with them and the students before school or during lunch or immediately after school tomorrow so they can talk with all of us and share their thoughts before we go to the museum of flight
Lol
do you guys have a group chat outside this because it seems like you all switched opinions in about 2 seconds (not being offensive just very confused)
<@U1F0BGMLN> seconded
*even though it is better
yes i did but we decided it won’t work as much as it is better
Another reason to have the meeting Tuesday is that I can tell a lot of us are super stressed, so acting quicker will get the stress out of the way quicker
Thurs won't work for deadlines or splinter group
wait didn't you just say that it need to be Thursday?
So everyone knows?
Can u send out an email?
Sounds good
guys this conversation is not going to get us anywhere i do think. we should refocus on getting everyone to the red barn classroom tomorrow night
That question should be added to google form
Excused absences can be handled
But if Gudor and Wilson aren't there the whole time I see no issue.
And if we don't go 4h, mentors will likely leave become of the hostile environment created by Tipton 
i'd be willing to go to court if she kicks me out. I feel like I would go to court for any students who are kicked out....
Isn't there the issue of robotics students not getting excused absences for events?
Exactly
Also if we decide to not go 4h mentors have already been kicked off for speaking out.
She can't kick y'all out of the school, but she can take you off the team. Suing is also expensive
?
and it should be completely disregarded 
yes but the people who are saying that are simply just trying to intimidate and manipulate us
Too
Sueing would take to long
if tipton kicks any of us out of the school, couldn't we just sue? what can she do to the students other than not allow the team to operate?
Agree with this
But not for the entire meeting
They would get a say
They don't care for the team, they are only interim coaches. They don't want to coach for the season. 
BC they are running parallel meeting
They would only be able to come part of the time
Okay, but there is also the bit about people fearing retribution from Tipton
If they skype, they can't shut us down 
I think they mainly care about the students who want to be on robotics, they said they didn't want to coach for hardly any time at all...
No because coach and Connie can come
But doesn't that defeat the purpose of having a meeting off campus?
Skype
That
We could invite them to skype in?
fine but how do we ensure that gudor and wilson feel welcome
Wednesday Meeting 
That too
wednesday night is the evening of learning, that doesn’t work
The point of the Tuesday meeting is nearly everyone can go
We can't have Wilson or Gudor there. By having them there, we will know that everything said will make its way back to Tipton, and kids will fear retribution. We need a day to voice ourselves to the mentors and be able to say what ever we want. 
The attendance would be far smaller
We could always do a Wednesday meeting the only question is who could attend.
Yeah. We need to make this decision before Thursday.
They have the right to an opinion
That's not fair
But we are preventing a splinter group from participating in FRC
exactly and by having both of these meetings we are involving the staff and the community 
And from what I know admin doesn't feel that way
And we need to involve the staff in those decisions 
We have deadlines on Thursday for grants and events. We need to make a decision on which way we are going before then
whoever they are (students), I believe that if they are informed, they will instantly realize the benefits to 4H and the school. No one at the school will have to worry about the safety of freshman and rides, the shop, having instructors at the school to facilitate people being there. I feel that if admin knew how much would be lifted off them, then I feel it's a no brainer.
yes but hopefully we can reduce the chance of that happening by having both meetings
Rn, those students who would leave are a part of our team
i feel like our first concern should be our own team right now
If we have a meeting on Thursday to decide 4H the other group may not have time to start its own FRC team
okay cool but i’m not sure that’s relevant to choosing meeting times here
The school wants to have a robotics team no matter what
did he give a reason why?
Gudor said regardless of if we become 4H in the school or outside, the school may wish to start a second team
well hopefully we could stay 4H in the school but otherwise exactly what tucker said
inform them about 4-H and hope they realize it's better?
But then what is the solution for the students who would leave skunk works if we turned 4H?
and it gives the freshmen more time to figure out rides home 
and the time can’t really be changed on the rbc meeting because mentors and parents are coming from work. which means that changing it to thursday solves that problem 
Gudor is concerned about getting freshmen rides home on short notice
Meeting time cannot be changed on the school meeting 
No
Start the school one earlier, (maybe 3:45 4:00) ?
could we just have the meeting at the RBC after the school one tomorrow?
i agree but this way it gives us time to coordinate everyone attending the off-campus meeting
it's either this team or they just "build" robots no FIRST at rahs
We need to make a decision in order to be fair to them
exactly
And that students who want a new team won't have time to make one
I guess it seems fine, but time is the main issue
I think they represent the students who want to join more than the teachers, they said they didn't want to be the ones who take over, just temporary.
okay but what are the thoughts on my idea up there^^^it seems like a way to make sure that gudor and wilson can express their thoughts and ideas about the team and that then we can go and discuss it on thursday
can also just report what happens, i'm not directly listening, but i'm here.
there is a robotics/ptsa meeting happening rn, tipton is here I'll ask when it's over if it wasn't discussed
Gudor seems to think that is impossible, but I keep hearing  Tipton is willing
We need to get that in writing or confirm it before we rely on that for decisions. 
somebody did and she said we could
(I don't know if this is rumor) I though I heard about someone asking tipton about having a 4-H team at the school (use the shop..) is that true?
Then if we go 4H the potential new team would have no chance to start a new team. Even if we don't like that some people may split off from wherever the majority goes, we need to give them the opportunity to participate in FRC
thoughts??^^
i think i possible approach that would mend relationships would be to hold a meeting among the skunk family on tuesday with gudor and wilson at the school so their voices are heard and being listened to and then on thursday we ask that the meeting be cancelled and then the skunk family meet in the RBC as we would have now heard from our coaches and all and then on thursday we can make a decision within in the skunk family
push off the meeting at the school?
According to teachers and students, we are not being fair to the group that would want a new team if we push this off
I can arrange a meeting later this week
So school has opportunity to start new team
If the school wants a non-4H team we need to decide if we go 4H tomorrow
<@U1FAR4AJU> did you say you can get access to the RBC on any night this week?
I know for a fact that not everyone on the team (students) knows what's going on
But a big thing that came out of the meeting was that the school will have a robotics team no matter what. They really want that team to be us. Idk how everyone feels about giving them a chance tomorrow 
More or less
that's the scoop?
or we have both and everyone eventually gets heard
So we either have one meeting (outside or in) or we have two. The one meeting option we exclude people because of the school and the timing outside.
We realize the entire skunk family will not be able to attend a meeting at school (like coach) but we could possibly set up a video conference and a way of inputting opinions through a anonymous source. Idk what you all think about keeping the meeting at school and involving parents, so a decision has not been made 
One of his big concerns was that he and ms wilson, our current coaches, are being kept out of the loop and not involved in important decisions. They believe that having a meeting offsite will drive a wedge in our team by excluding the teacher perspective. 
Rip sent that prematurely
He just said yesterday that the vote is occurring.
Ok so I don't feel a strong need to go so unless someone requests that I go I probably won't 
It's not actually included on the agenda, so I'm clarifying with Mr. Smith over email about that
Agenda:

Officer elections

selecting a financial review committee for last years books.
Is that it?
i.e. where the money is going to go
The agenda is voting on whether the spaghetti dinner will be put on booster club books or PTSA books
What is the agenda? I'm debating on going or staying home and doing home work 
Who alls going to the booster club meeting?
At 6 o'clock
12015 Roseberg Ave S, Seattle, WA 98168
Also for reference:
if anyone needs a ride to the booster club meeting I can oblige
<!channel> right now there's an informal meeting in the conference room  on the first floor for general discussion and planning tomorrow's meeting. Feel free to attend.
must be something with the slack web app
all good
my bad
apparently slack didn't load that in
I can see it too
Its all there, just really high up
May just be the internet connection.
I can see all of it
I can't see any of the conversation that happened over the weekend, the ones where we were talking about the meeting being on such short notice
We're on the slack free plan so I can't view deleted messages
Which messages?
did someone delete all the messages over the weekend?
<!channel>
^ that seems important
<@U1F1ETJM7> pinned a message to this channel.
I will let people know at lunch if the other meeting can be moved. Otherwise, those going to the RBC will need to email Gudor and Wilson saying they can't make the school-sanctioned meeting
You can't argue that meetings are being scheduled at times you can't make, and at times you 100% can make
The reason for another meeting held at this time is so that everybody can be on the same page about decisions being made. You were worried about decisions being made at the meeting you could not attend, so we're trying to find solutions to that problem. We're not trying to exclude anybody or disrespect authority; we're trying to do the exact opposite.
There are three other free days in a week and you chose this one. You shouldnt be messing with the routine of everyone else because you made a mistake.
You cant, no. But your coaches and any other students who attend can, and there will be current students in attendance.
We can't educate new students if no one is there
Holding the meeting earlier will allow students to attend both meetings
here's the thing: most of the mentors and the students are aware of another meeting scheduled on top of that that is more important to the future of the team.
The robotics practice will be held at school. The new students and any others will be there. The interim coaches and others will be there and have a plan to teach the students and get them ready for build season as it comes.
Oh wait I understand
Until 6?
Ok because the RBC is booked until 6
^ right now we have no way of telling the freshmen either not to show up or to come to our meeting. They won't let us make an announcement and they won't let us cancel the meeting. We have every intention of holding the meeting we discussed
So that the freshmen aren't left completely behind
We are just looking at changing the time of the at-school meeting
We are still meeting at the same time
let’s meet up and send out something during lunch?
Are we still meeting? Idk I just saw th slack messages 
Yay!!!!!!
thank you!!!
Hey so I just got the RBC over at the museum reserved for 6pm....
I mean it's not my decision
Could I get it to 4-5 then? At least try?
And I don't think that gudor/wilson (not that its their choice, they might not be allowed to say yes) would sign on
we won't be able to move off campus quick enough to a new site, unless we do secure a spot at the MoF
Just got a suggestion to move at school meeting to 5-6 so that we can deal with freshmen. How do people feel about this?
We're getting screwed right now. By October we'll either have access to the shop or not.
This is happening now, and there's no way that a flyer article can truly represent the situation that has occurred. Regardless of how good of a writer he is, he is going to be formal, and again its too far in the future to do any good
That's faaaaar too long
Soon team leads, Tipton, and hopefully a mentor or two will speak to Timothy who is writing an article in October
I don't know if now is the right time, but soon for sure.
One other thing we should think about is when we should start talking to the rest of the school about this. Thomas Kirby and I are talking right now and we believe that we would get a _huge_ amount of support from the student body if we start talking truthfully about everything that has happened and how we have been wronged. I know things are still in flux and being decided, but I think that if everybody understood the situation as well as we did, suddenly Tipton has 400 students against her, not 40.
doesn't look like the email Zuzanna sent out went to a mentor group as well
That sounds like a good idea
Okay. We can make sure that all of the students are aware, but it's up to us as well to make sure that the mentors that were not in the meeting are aware as well. Most of them should be on the email list, but if you have personal contacts, it may be a good idea to reach out.
^^^exactly
Technically a different meeting will be held at the school, but students who will attend that meeting will not have a say in the direction of the team
I mean, I guess they can show up for the entire time if they want to, but we need to make it clear to students that the meeting will *_not_* be held at the school tomorrow.
Yeah but it wasn't just students deciding it.
While not many were at the meeting, it was certainly a student suggestion to hold this meeting at this time
I think this is a really important distinction about how we may be treated moving forward.
It wasn't our decision, it was the _teams_ decision, but we're not recognized as our own entity anymore I guess
That's really frustrating.
He will not cancel. He says it is not up to the students to cancel, and he is sorry for giving us that impression
How much does gudor know? I'm in his class rn but I don't know what to talk about besides saying "cancel the meeting"
Thanks for sending me the email guys, and thanks <@U1F0QEL0Z> for the explanation!
Okay Gudor and Wilson will not cancel the meeting. Those of you who do not wish to help decide the future of the team may meet at the school. However, everyone who will come to the off campus meeting to hear what is going on, voice their opinions, and make a decision, MUST email <mailto:michael.gudor@highlineschools.org|michael.gudor@highlineschools.org> and <mailto:karen.wilson@highlineschools.org|karen.wilson@highlineschools.org> saying you will not be attending.
Tipton mentioned the ASB intercom as a way of notifying freshmen, but she does not agree that the meeting is cancelled, which I am working on rn
Whoops
Done
I can
Can someone forward the email to Kenny?
It was cancelled because for one we don't want tipton to be apart of it so we can inform the team as a whole of the options we can take, re-hashing what went on Sunday, and because Steele isn't allowed on campus. I believe those were the two main reasons why.
I didn't get the email either so I don't have a sense of why the meeting was cancelled
When I was talking about "where this goes tomorrow", I was referring to whatever you were going to do today to announce it to the freshmen Izzie -- whether it be with announcing it on the intercom or something else
Nobody responded to my statement here and I decided not to make the announcement because I was afraid of making a false announcement
<@U1F06GSNQ> Am I correct in assuming that you said nvm after checking with someone else if you could release that message on the PSA?
Why never mind?
Nvm, we're going to have to see where this goes tomorrow
I can announce it on the PSA to get the message to some of the new students
Ok 
It's a work in progress
Multiple times
Chances are that will be released via intercom
I am speaking with Gudor and Wilson about letting them know it has been cancelled
I think we should let them figure it out
I am handling that
that seems a bit too crazy
Cause we encouged them to go
Should we send out something to the freshmen or new sophomores that wanted to attend the Tuesday meeting too
Um
Your welcome
Thanks Brandon!

Thanks

Okay thanks
I can send it to brandon
it must be the mail application that you use. but what’s your email brandon
I can forward it to evryone who was on FTC but i need david to forward it to me
To be fair <@U27TQ5U7K>, the formatting looks fine on my mom's outlook account
Okay can someone forward the email to <@U5M1Q2ZJT> and <@U7388S8CF> 
I haven't gotten anything either 
Could someone with her email forward it to her?
Formatting has been fixed!
She didn’t get it because the only email lists it was sent to was ones that Mr. Smith put together by class and the new students are on FRC Team and FRC Students etc. he doesn’t move them all. 
Have you signed up for team emails yet?
Was is it supposed to be the notes from today or something?
hmm that’s weird
I didn't get anything??

Why is it an e e Cummings poem

sorry about that, i have no idea what happened as it looked perfectly fine

<!channel> last chance to fill out the survey, link is in the message I sent originally or in the channel pins. 
^ make them feel wanted
Just a quick thing...I want to encourage everyone to be thankful of our mentors, at the meeting today, and just in general. They do a lot for the team, and a lot of that work is behind the scenes, so please thankful and encouraging towards them as they are donating hundreds and even thousands of volunteer hours to help us learn and succeed.
I'll be there 
Sadly I can't, my dad will be there tho
<@U1F6AR1NF> are you going?
I also know <@U1F1ETJM7> will be going
And <@U73DQN95H> 
I'll be there
I am
And <@U1F05PEAY> 
And <@U1HABM1NE>

<@U1F0BGMLN> and I are
Who all is going to the meeting today?
We have qualitative feedback, but we are summarizing that and not posting it because some people include identifying phrases
That's good, I would like more input than that, like to actually know who the people are. I mean right now the graphs are just "theoretical person or bowlin?"
Not for at least another week
Ok
So are we eventually going to get a list of potential coaches? Like their names? Or are we just going to ask for something general, like "FIRST-associated person" and then Tipton gives us whatever she wants
Yeah....
Purple is "Eithrr"
Outside hire with FIRST experience
What does the pink stand for?
Purple, Light Blue, and Pink on main coach graph were written in
Exactly
Someone typed that into other
There was an "anyone but Bowlin" selection? Oh shit I didn't see that

I can give out pie charts rn, just give me a sec
<!channel> ^
^ what do other people think
That's a good idea too
Why not just do it at the Tuesday meeting, I mean that’s when everyone’s going to be in the same room at the same time 
Lol yeah, is it still too early to know the results of the survey?
Whatever works for everyone
 ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Last time it was in Joshi's room before school. Time before that was in cad lab.
When and where
Yeah, but do we want a post-meeting discussion about what happened too like last time or just the notes?
I can take notes at the meeting if that’s what you mean 
well so far it seems like the majority of kids can't go, so we need some kind of reliable source to learn what happened at the meeting
What do you mean?
I can't go either, but we should probably have an in person meeting to discuss what happened when a few students went to talk to the mentors
I can't go but it's okay
only a pre-calc kid this math is way over my head
Memed?
well tucker is right its an expression, but you know
:purple_heart::blue_heart::heart::gift_heart::yellow_heart::revolving_hearts::two_hearts::heavy_heart_exclamation_mark_ornament::heartbeat::heartpulse::sparkling_heart::cupid:
it's an expression tho
? no its definitely just root 7
x is every number
I mean
Thank you Nick
isnt that imaginary?
rofl my guy
Or wanna be anonymous 
Or post in Google form if you can't come
Take a deep breath ppl lets not argue this. Bottom line: there's a meeting Sunday planned without knowledge of all the team that we cannot really change. Show up if you can, ask someone to say what you need to say if you can't. Next time, we can trust that you'll all have more advance but work with it for now kk?
About not being hostile? I agree that sometimes it seems like certain opinions aren't welcome among certain groups of students, but it sorta seemed like u were saying that in response to Tucker
Jesus
can someone help with my math homework. (x^2)+7, x=??
There's plenty of other points that I made that you can focus on as well

It seemed like he was just stating fact...
We are all hostile at times and this is through text so you might interpret it differently than I do
I didn't see Tucker being hostile....
Why is there always so much hostility. No wonder we can't function, we can't trust each other. When all we do is bitch at each other and complain and think that we're better than each other we don't ever get anything done. I know I don't feel comfortable giving any of my opinions because I know there's two sides and no matter what I say I'm gonna piss off one side and I don't really want to do that. We need to be unified with students and mentors but we are divided and we're too busy nacking at each other and getting mad and angry and frustrated at each other we can't come together it's just not going to happen. I think there should've been more communication and I understand that it's short notice but it would've been nice unrealistically. I asked the question because I didn't understand and I don't know if you're commenting on what I had to say tucker but I don't know how to respond to you without pissing off one side of the team or the other because are obviously split on what we want and where we want to go with the team. It does seem a little back roomy for us to meet like this but I do understand the short notice. I wish I could speak freely and not feel judgment and not feel like what I have to say is going to put me in a bad position with some of the team and mentors because my opinion isn't the same as yours Tucker, but I feel like the hostility that you have towards anybody that doesn't exactly aline with your opinion is punished one way or another. We all need to feel comfortable and safe talking to each other freely and openly if you don't like something we should be able to say and not fear Judgment in hate from each other. That's our proper team and should function in my eyes. We are so broken and so split that I don't see how we can all be happy with the outcome of anything really. So if anyone has any ideas so we can all be happy I'd love to hear it even if you think it's going to go against the common opinion. I just want to hear everyone's ideas I won't judge you, but I can't promise about anybody else. message me privately if you want but I'd prefer to be in here so everyone can see everyone else's opinions so that we start to work towards a safer friendlier team for everyone 
That's the time crunch
And I'm not saying its bad to give opinions, but us students thinking we can make the entire thing happen is a complete farse. 
No coach + no mentors = not meeting requirements
And we can't register our team if we don't meet the requirements for a FIRST team as well
Oh okay
Closes jeez
Closed
Then first pref closed
We only have until Thirsday
^ exactly
I thought it was preference based so we didnt have to worry about being late
Also, event sign ups opened up yesterday. Was anybody aware of that? It's not a big problem because its a different system than it was last year, but we're already starting to miss dates
We just need a main goal for.the team
Those things too
We need to be able to explain the plan to them for the year
There is a booster club meeting AND a meeting with Tipton on Monday
We have new kids coming on
On*
Why not just talk in Tuesday with everyone? Am I missing the urgency that it has to be Sunday? 
Ok Eli scheduled what he could in the timeframe we have
Its not important what is important is the motivational speech hidden within that I wrote when I was half asleep
Just statements 
I just feel like one way communication, from either side, isn't especially helpful because it doesn't allow for conversations
Could you clarify pronouns please and the context if it sent late?
Fuck that sent late
No he's not and he is right. This is our team now. We need to work together and that's what this group chat is for. This year is our opportunity to rise up and come back from before and we all want that. Focus on the long run here guys
*agreement with Eli
Because for once we want to make choices? So we talk to each other and have secret meetings like they do?
No, it's supposed to be a discussion
It is a meeting for us to share our opinions
I don’t think that saying that is disrespectful. 
The meeting isn’t about us. It’s about their opinions. If you do in fact share what is said with us then why would they need us all to be there. 
It's not a meeting for the students to voice their opinion though. It's for the mentors to tell us what they think (ok I miss read)
That is incredibly disrespectful to the mentors
I think the mentors will listen to the kids that are there but many students won't be able to make it because of the short notice and their opinions won't be heard
You said they chose the time and it’s their meeting, so why would they change it because not all the students can go. They want to share their opinions so as long as at least one student is there, I get the feeling that is good enough for them. 
The time was not set quickly to exclude people
It was planned without most of the teams input and sprung on us without proper time to make arangements
It feels like a back room meeting like the parent meetings used to be.
I'm not trying to be passive agressive, sorry if it's coming off that way, I'm just trying to understand what people mean
Omg this is why our team is broken dude. 
Are you saying you don't think our opinions would be heard?
I just don’t want to argue about something that isn’t really in our control. Eli said that mentors decided the time so there’s no use in us as students arguing about it. I was upset and reacted out of impulse and that wasn’t necessary. 
Why are we all hostile toward each other shit dude. Everyone just needs to chill out. Difference in opinion is ok. Not understand that is what got us in this mess in the first place
Okay. 
It’s gonna be word for word
Oh my god
Second hand information again. Let’s be honest, they aren’t going to change the date or time so there’s no use arguing over it. It sucks and it isn’t fair and it’s poorly planned but we can move on. 
I’ve just asked a few mentors for their take. I’ll add their comments into this chat if that’s better for everyone
Yea it’s not Eli’s fault he was simply trying to organize a meeting. I can’t make it this Sunday though
no make another chat because they can see the previous conversations
Nah just let them voice their opinion in a different chanel
Because I get it; the meeting deadline is really short. I'm trying my best to compile what everyone needs
Temporary access
After they give their take
No
We could remove mentors later 
And I did my best to incorporate options for people that couldn't make it
No
<@U1F1NQKAN> Should I add mentors to this chat? They can discuss it directly if you'd like
*listed
Tucker just listened options for it not to be 2nd hand info
Is it the finale say? No.
2nd hand information like always though
Sometimes we miss meetings
I know I'm not going to be there because of my mom, I'm fine with that because I know I can get the info later. 
I appreciate Eli organizing the meeting. No it is not his fault but such a short notice is a bit hard especially if it is on a weekend. 
But we don't have time. We have been wanting to know what is going on, and sooner is better than later
Maybe we all could have organized something further back. It’s not Eli’s fault
Hence, later on. Not in two days. Maybe in a week. 
<@U1F1ETJM7> pinned a message to this channel.
Or just told us it was in progress
Not much more time to organize
Coach was fired on Monday
And he should have organized something farther in advance. 
From what I heard he literally organized this within the last day or two
Again would've been nice to know this was in progressive 
I cannot make it Sunday. It is not fair, as ailis mentioned, to hold a meeting as important as this on such a short notice.
We are on a time crunch, just to get some insight into what they think and its the worst thing ever? If eli already agreed on a date I think we should stick to it. It's not impossible to record the conversation and for people to be on speaker calls... I think It's good that he organized it because we haven't even talked to them. Better now than never. Nothings going to happen in one night.
Yeah I would've loved more of a heads up on that... 
*Think
I do thing we are running out of time on things like signing up for events, things that require us to know where we stand as a team
Next weekend would probably be better
Two days notice for a meeting that is this important is completely unfair and not okay. I’m glad that this is the date and time that works for you and the key mentors that you’re speaking of but as a result you are alienating the students that have busier schedules or already have plans. What about people going to church on Sunday? People who are out of town like Erin. Just like you’re saying this isn’t just all about the students, it isn’t all about the mentors. Planning this meeting is a step in the right direction for full open communication but there has to be more notice. 
<!channel> 
Hey guys. After having conversations with a few mentors yesterday, I personally have come to the conclusion that before we finalize our plans for the team, we need to make sure that the voices of our mentors are heard. I don't say this lightly, but I believe that if we continue to try to make decisions on our own, the decisions we make will be incomplete. We thought that by making these decisions on our own, we would be able to steer away from parent and mentor bias. However, how can we make decisions about the team without the team involved? From the conversations I've had, I've come to understand that some of the mentors feel unwanted; specifically about their opinions. They don't feel welcome back after coach was fired from his position, and after Thomas was removed from his role as volunteer. By excluding mentors from the decisions we're making as a "team," we're effectively telling the mentors that we no longer value their input. If we don't value their input, we don't function as a team. We lose the skunk family. To be clear: I don't think that any of us intentionally did anything wrong. I feel that in the midst of it all, we haven't considered all of the different points of view that we should have. 

I don't believe the situation is lost however. I know that personally I love the mentors, and they've had an incredibly profound impact on my life that I couldn't even come close to describing. It hurt like Mr. Bowlin described at the parent meeting, and it came as a shock to hear that some of them feel like we don't value their input, and that they no longer feel like we have the same goals in mind. I think it's past time that we start sharing and engaging in discussion with the mentors that we've worked with and trusted for multiple years at this point. The mentors have made it clear that they're interested in our ideas as much as they want us to hear theirs; it needs to be a two way street where we feel comfortable discussing everything robotics related. I've been helping to setup a meeting this weekend at Trevor Gardner's house, 9/24 on Sunday at 1PM address 611 SW 201st St. Normandy Park, WA 98166. Please try to organize carpools, for parking is limited. Also, if enough people show up, please be ready to move outside and hold the discussion there, where we would have to stand if you don't bring your own seating. If it really is too many people, we may move to Marvista Park where there is a big enough gazebo to host us. The parties invited to participate in discussion about the team are the students, the mentors, and the parents. Everybody should have a say in the decisions that are being made for the team. It is critical that as many people come to the meeting as possible, but if you can't make it we will take detailed notes on what happened so that everyone can stay on the same page. If you have any questions, please feel free to ask them here or in person and I'll answer to the best of my ability.

Whether you can be there or not, feel free to make comments in this Google form <https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYyQmuRyQrcdY2o1hEDdQLqmbb2JBn88isefXbyOj1S3C5xw/viewform> - anonymous or not as you choose. If you can't be there, we can share your comments.
Oh end of school day
Done^
Ok I apologize, I was under the impression it was due at the end of the day otherwise I would have gotten it sooner
It’s not fair to leave anyone out. So we are trying to get the last 8
We are missing 8 responses. The cutoff was actually at 2 pm. We just want more accurate results
Yes. 
So if we just did it will it be added
I thought that was right now since the cutoff was right now?
When we are don’t getting everyone’s responses 
Cool, when do we get to see the results?
Right now. 
Yeah. When is the cutoff for the survey?
e
Not befor
Just now
It's cool now
Oh my gosh, I didn't realize I had done that, I'm extremely sorry 
I believe she removed herself
To be clear: Izzie and Angelina are students, Elizabeth is a mentor
<https://skunkworksteam1983.slack.com/archives/G76M3SUDC/p1505884673000127>
Cora added her accidentally
<@U1F408NA0> yeah wth???
Uh why was izzies mom in this groupchat and how long was she here for?
<@U4YA0M2QJ> has left the group
<!channel> Okay, we are almost halfway through the day and we have only 20 responses! That means about 18 more people need to respond ASAP! We need responses by 2 pm!
Please read the job descriptions for coach and assistant coach! We have received at least one response saying that assistant coach does more interaction with the team. Actually we are looking at a scenario where the lead coach does more interaction with the team and the assistant coach does more admin so that the one interacting with the team is the one with the final say (addresses some communication breakdowns).
<https://goo.gl/forms/T8IM0o0OnvqltUJe2>
Here's the new survey! Please complete by end of school day tomorrow. To be clear: Mr. Gudor and Ms. Wilson do NOT want to be our coaches, they are just interim coaches.
Joshi too
Wilson and Gudor will be at the meeting tonight, and will help run things until a new coach is appointed.
I think Wilson and joshi have?
I know that Gudor has specifically expressed interest, I don't know about Wilson or others
Currently not an active mentor, maybe stepping down volunteer role?
For curious people, this is Chelsea Olsen: <https://www.linkedin.com/in/olschelsea/>
Okay <@U1F06GSNQ> 
Idk what Tipton's plan is <@U1F408NA0> 
Relating to robotics, the only thing Ms. Tipton said was that she acknowledges the stress levels coming from the students this week
How is our survey going to translate into some of us going to interview prospective coaches? Like I think that Bowlin should still be interviewed, and all prospective coaches shouldn't know what we're going to ask them so its fair. Also I'm not aware if some, like Joshi, want to be coach or assistant coach.
Any more feedback?
You guys don't need to go, David and I will send you guys every detail of the meeting just in case she does talk about robotics
Plz post results
That's the main point of the meeting, but she'll most likely be stating concerns about robotics
Probably don't talk about this during that meeting for now?
The real question is, should we be trying to be there
Yeah
ASB stuff right?
David and I are about to meet with Ms. Tipton homies 
Thanks.
I'll talk to him rn
I
When and who will share the info with Bowlin?
Yes
So this is open info at this point, the pie chart
You can talk with parents
...So we can talk with mentors but not parents?
We can suggest, it is up to her in the end.
We will share info with parents once Tipton makes a decision
Yes
(inside the team)
are we free to share the pie chart and the fact there was (basically) a vote other places?
when will we share this information with mentors/parents?
Chelsea Olsen is someone highly involved in FIRST
Best Case Scenario
Head Coach: Mr. Bowlin
Assistant Coach: Chelsea Olson/Gudor/Wilson/Joshi/Bien-Aime
Reach out for new mentors who have new ideas.
Here's what we will be saying to Tipton (summary):
Pink was involved, helpful, and open-minded
Light blue was staff OR FIRST
Purple was someone who doesn't know team or school for fresh start
They got cut off in what I'm seeing... I'll try to find it
<@U1F1ETJM7> uploaded a file: <https://skunkworksteam1983.slack.com/files/U1F1ETJM7/F76UPJZ34/image.png|image.png>
What do the options that were cut off in the pie chart say?
I have no idea.
we can decide to change coach*
this is a random question, don't take connotation with this. Does us being part of the interview committee instate the precendent that we can change at any time?
These were the results of the survey for first choice coach.
<@U1F0P4FA5> uploaded a file: <https://skunkworksteam1983.slack.com/files/U1F0P4FA5/F773C3EAH/pie_charts.docx|Pie Charts.docx>
That's the intent of the meeting tonight
Yes
are the prospective student’s parents invited to tonights meeting?
Okay, we are missing just a few more students! Last call!
I just wanted to clarify that this survey is anonymous, your name isn't attached to it at all. Again please fill this out before lunch 
If you don’t respond by lunchtime we won’t be able to take your opinion into account before our meeting. 
Friendly reminder: We do need everyone to fill out this form! So far we have 18 responses, but it would be nice to get everyone's opinions to be taken into account.
Please fill out the form below ASAP. Erin, Izzie, and I would like input before our meeting with admin tomorrow afternoon. We need all the responses by our lunch meeting on Thursday at the absolute latest. 

Students are welcome to sit in on and watch the lead meeting at lunch, to promote transparency, but not participate so that our meeting runs more efficiently.

<https://goo.gl/forms/H6DC2t07DdaTdDOC2>
I will be (as apart of ASB)
Who's going to be at that meeting other than you, asb, and tipton?
Yeah, I don't think there are many rumors
Definitely
I haven't as of yet heard anything untrue
So are the rest of us
According to Catie (ASB President), Ms. Tipton is concerned with rumors spreading throughout the school relating to the robotics events of the past few days
Do you know what might be covered relevant to robots? (Sorry if u already said, I probably forgot)
Yup
Tomorrow during 6th?
Administration/ASB meeting is this Thursday at the beginning of 6th period, just in case any of you guys need the date
good to hear
Sort of late to the party, but from what I discussed with Bowlin (in this sense I'm disconnecting the fact he is my dad), it seems as though the student message didn't fall flat. What was trying to be conveyed was that we haven't had the time to figure out what the future looked like exactly. Tipton forced the option with coach and the desilvas. Because each of our sides, students, mentors, parents haven't talked yet. I know what my opinion is, but how could I ever know what the parents or mentors really think.
<!channel> meeting has started in Joshi's room 2nd floor end of the hallway on the right, if you're running late just walk on in.
yup, just come when you can <@U7388S8CF> 
I won't be able to make it till after 8 is that okay? 
If someone is there before 8am, do we want to ask tipton if we can use the PLC?
Yeah, we misjudged it. However, we still answered "What is your opinion?" with "We want our opinions heard."
I don't think our message fell flat, I think if there's one thing the parents will walk away with it's that we want to be involved. Next time we come with many many more questions and opinions, because they've made it clear that's what they're now looking for. Today was the first kind of meeting where they've asked for this; we prepared for the worst but weren't prepared for the best. That's not on us.
Our message fell flat though. We said we wanted our opinions heard, then said nothing else. The least we could have done was asked questions when the parents asked us if there was anything else we wanted to say
I agree, I think we were far better prepared to be shut out of the meeting instead of being beckoned and asked for our opinions. I'm glad that <@U1F09HT4N> was able to summarize what we talked about, but at the same time I do wish we had asked more questions. I think some of us were worried (I know I was) that if we asked bad questions or stumbled over our words, we may not have been asked to come to future meetings. I would not be ashamed of tonight, we met like adults, we agreed on our position, and respectfully listened in on the meeting. Erin conveyed what we wanted for student involvement in the future, some of us asked clarifying questions, but we weren't an overbearing presence. We did what we set out to do: we stood our ground, we made our point about being included, and we didn't take over their meeting.
By the way <@U1F0P4FA5>, responding to your message in snapchat about it being a shame that we shut each other down for asking questions; (purely personal opinion and open to discussion) I do not believe that today was the day for unpolished questions to the general group. While it was embarrassing to me that we weren't able to come up with much to say. we weren't prepared to say much more. We didn't know that we were going to be as well accepted as we were; we were making plans of what do to if they wanted us to leave instead of preparing for a discussion with everybody included. Instead of Tipton being blindsided with the possibility of 4H, we were blindsided by the possibility that they wanted us to be included in the conversation. I think that students shutting other students down was simply so that we can continue to at least be on the same page on issues and where we stand, if not be in complete agreement on them. Again, this is purely from what I got out of the situation, so please feel free to say what you truly believe
<@U2KDG2552> has joined the group
We need to talk about the future direction of the team
Just a student debrief
All good. I was wondering, what's gonna happen during the meeting? Or is that confidential? 
if people need rides, i know we talked a little about that today, you can say where you live and somone close by can probably pick you up
Whenever you can make it
I'll probably get there at 8:30. I can't get there an earlier.
8-9 tomorrow morning.
8am?
Yes. If you can make it please do
So there's still a meeting in joshi's room at 8 tomorrow??? 
Also we're trying to keep most of this information within the team right now.
I think that's all I have thats directly pertinent to our situation right now. Anyone can ask clarifying questions or add to important parts I missed.
For the hiring process, Tipton promised that students (note the plural) would have a seat on the hiring team. From what Tipton said, she made it sound like it would most likely be Gudor, Wilson, or Bowlin. I do not recall if she mentioned the possibility of hiring from outside the current school staff. The other main point that was discussed is that there needs to be a Robotics ASB formed to manage the flow of money through the PTSA to the team. As of now (as far as I know) no decision has been finalized about how the ASB will be selected, and whether they will be elected by the students or not.
(little more coming)
The meeting started at 7 in the BPC, where many parents, many students, many mentors, and Ross (who doesn't really fit into those categories) came. The PTSA board was there, Connie was there, the DeSilvas were there, but Coach did not come (I do not know if he was invited or not.) Tipton would not answer questions about why coach had been removed, or what the interaction was between her and Thomas DeSilva. We learned about two possible options for the team. One was staying with the school, and losing coach definitaly as a paid position, but we don't even know if he will be welcomed back as a mentor for the team as a mentor. Tipton said she would have an answer soon about that. The other option is to become a 4H team, which means that we would separate from the school. This would almost garuntee that we would lose access to the shop in the immediate sense, but there is a chance that we would be able to work on school property in the future. This option has not been researched much yet (and if it has, the results of said research were not shared with the group). We don't know if we would get the money that we have with PTSA if we split from the team, so that would have to be considered as well. As of right now, we are staying with the team, and we do not have an interim coach announced yet before we go through the hiring process.
(part about the parent meeting coming next)
The situation was that coach was removed from the team by decree of Tipton. At the parent meeting tonight, it because unclear exactly who made the final call, as she was not allowed to answer (she did this many times where she said she couldn't answer. We don't know the exact reason but we have to assume its legitimate). Many students met after school on property that Erin's dad had access to. We mostly discussed what we wanted to do at the parent meeting, and in the 2 and a half hours we had we decided that we wanted to sit and listen to everybody's point of view, and if we were going to ask questions they would be either personal questions, or questions agreed upon by the group so that it was clear that each student spoke for themselves. We did not have enough time to discuss questions we wanted to ask as a group, which was a mistake, as we were asked many times questions that we had for them which caught us very off guard.
ill do my best
Also all team meeting tomorrow at 8am in Joshi's room
Eli can you please give a brief summary of our student meeting and the parent meeting as many of the people on here were not there
only the stuff in the emails
