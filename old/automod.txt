!am markov 1983
clean out the following survey
that's a good one
LOL
They won't let us have time to figure out what the truth is.... who do we not spam this chat if that�s better for everyone else because you made a commitment to helping clean out the following survey.
!am markov 1983
We are missing just a few days ago, he wasn't trying to move towards that Just wanted to give names anyways at some point I feel like our first concern should be clarified.
!am markov 1983
Let's just say that the most about the students other than not allow the team is going, that's my two cents Do you have a plan to them for the freshmen, so unless Tipton does something, the freshmen aren't left completely behind We are doing a separation of two teams and now we have practice tomorrow yo if anyone needs a ride to the booster club meeting?
!am markov 1983
Which adults in particular Why do we have no way that there wouldn't be a good idea Okay.
!am markov 1983
It is also the bit about people going to translate into some of the team Just a heads up on that...
!am markov 1983
I can Can someone forward the email I wrote @channel The DeSilva's have graciously agreed to Well I have thats directly pertinent to our situation right now.
!am markov 1983
if people need rides, i know is that okay?
!am markov 1983
That means about 18 more people I will continue the tradition so many have worked so hard to build.
!am markov 1983
We don't know how to attach it here My bad I had done that, I'm extremely sorry I believe he has to take your opinion is ok.
!am markov 1983
I�m glad that <@U1F09HT4N> was able to come out of whatever this fiasco was, together and that's what matters right now and address that tomorrow I can oblige <!channel> right now there's an informal meeting in Gudor's after school on Tuesday specifically Yeah, you should also forward that email to Kenny?
!am markov 1983
In all fairness they have said it aint happening.
!am markov 1983
no!
Please RSVP if you are getting at.
!am markov 1983

I feel like I feel a student meeting today and he doesn't have a say in things No Steve Burke is back.
!am markov 1983
We need to go?
!am markov 1983
aww, how wholesome
We just need to be helpful.
!am markov 1983
Please complete by end of school board meetings before.
!am markov 1983

If anyone is saying that are forcing this and try to force this to make it I'll probably get there at 8:30.
!am markov 1983
They do a lot better for everyone. just a few minutes while this change is completed.
!am markov 1983
By having them there, we can drive the trucks get here If you don't like something we should start talking to the table to discuss what it may mean for the team.
!am markov 1983

I'll ask him about that; it should be on speaker calls...
!am markov 1983

!am markov 1983
I'm not the only one sick of clicking the notification on slack and having to choose in the FRC Team email, but I would not be my final choice I don't think our message fell flat though.
!am markov 1983
These are starting to make too much sense
I can't go either, but we weren't on tuesday?
!am markov 1983
I have no i thought you were emailing gudor and wilson before emailing everyone else? or not as you choose.
!am markov 1983
hey I said that part
I understand correctly the voting system I proposed is going on, voice their opinion which is important, if they want is a necessary step.
!am markov 1983
Most of them either.
!am markov 19843

!am markov 1000
Mostly parents I know that not all of us asked clarifying questions, but we should think about keeping the meeting tonight is cancelled?
!am markov 1000
I know we are setting up a very valid point but I would only ask that the students that have busier schedules or already have plans.
!automoderator markov 140
Who says we can't work together and stronger I don't think either side would exclude them Also, if the split but if we can attempt to be coach or assistant coach.
!am markov 1000
<@U1F0BJN5U> pinned a message to this channel.
lol
Administration has made it clear that they're interested in our control.
!am markov 1000
it could get offensive lol
She was terrified to speak out a couple of times and was torn apart for simply speaking up.
ok lol
!automoderator markov 1400
<@U1F0QEL0Z> not out of here when its hooked into students please
tfw
When is the desilvas house they are unwilling to accept you for who you are.
!am markov 1000

From what Tipton said, she made it clear that the voices of our team But I hadn�t seen the video No I know things are still my friend.
!am markov 1000
okay this is really good
I mean he apologized about it later, but in this groupchat and how we can be moved.
!am markov 100
We as the students and mentors because my opinion isn't the only thing stopping us from meeting at the 4H Team meeting tonight, and will not cancel the meeting.
!am markov 1000
EVERYONE IS ON THE SIDEWALK
Jim Smith about that, isn't he at the parent meeting, and it wasn't final? going to seriously tell me that everyone is on the sidewalk.
!am markov 5555
jesus
FUCK
Please try to change coach* this is shattering the team and should function in my eyes.
!automoderator markov 140
If someone is there always so much and I hate to say if you disagree.
!automoderator markov 140
If someone is there Holding the meeting just in general.
!automoderator markov 140
there we go
They say they're on our side then they said that there would be heard?
!am markov 100
I don't think it switched hold on
Gear not being properly really hindered the hopper's performance Don't know if you noticed it, or maybe it was to make sure people knew what they want, and also we're talking very close but a little concerning, that is thru the mentors will probably be at different chapters in the final designing phase to assure reliability.
!am markov 9853
@-p without the dash LOL
The benefits of this drive train stuff with Isaac Isaac: not sure exactly what your talking about is super cool.
!automoderator markov 140
Hey, I just wanted to check in with how you feel, how do you have to @-p without the dash yeah sure that too?
!automoderator markov 140
I doubt the mentors will probably have direct experience with the relic.
!am markov 100
lol
lets do it
that will get shitty REAL quick
fuck dude
you should do it from the students slack
I'm looking it up by Tuesday Also, what do u know about the 4H meeting is not bad.
!am markov 100
If it's close it is easier to accommodate everyone.
!am markov 100
